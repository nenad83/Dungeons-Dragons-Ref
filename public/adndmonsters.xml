					<p>Just like tieflings, aasimar are plane-touched creatures that can't quite be called human. In their veins flows the blood of both humankind and one of the races of the Upper Planes - the rilmani, the eladrins, or the guardinals. Aasimar are beautiful creatures, with calm, serene features and an inner radiance that shines from their faces. They've got long manes of white-gold hair, and bright, piercing eyes that seem to look right though a basher. It's easy to mistake an aasimar for a human of unnatural purity, a half-elf, or even an agathinon. Aasimar tend to be noble, honest, and courageous cutters, but a body shouldn't always assume an aasimar means him well; they are a few cross-traders and knights of the post among the aasimar, despite their noble birth.</p>
					<p>Aasimar are scattered throughout the Outlands and Upper and Neutral Planes, but naturally avoid prolonged stays on any of the Lower Planes. (They're too likely to be mistaken for an aasimon of some kind, and a tanar'ri or baatezu can't stand the sight of an aasimon.) They usually dress to fit in with the population around them, so an aasimar living among the elven folk of Arborea dresses like an elf and assumes many of his hosts' mannerisms. When an aasimar's moved to great emotion, his heritage shines through his face like sunlight through clouds. There aren't many evil bashers who can look an angry aasimar in the eye.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Aasimar are upright and fair warriors with deep respect of strength and faith. Unfortunately, their mixed blood makes them somewhat frail. All aasimar gain bonusses of +1 to Strength and Wisdom, and suffer a -2 penalty to Constitution. It's real hard to sneak up on basilar; they've got senses like a cat's, it seems. All aasimar have infravision to a range of 60' and gain a +1 bonus to surprise checks due to their unnatural hearing and alertness. <b><u>Aasimar suffer only half damage from fire and cold, and gain a +2 to saving throws versus any kind of </u></b><b><i><u>charm </u></i></b><b><u>, </u></b><b><i><u>fear </u></i></b><b><u>, </u></b><b><i><u>emotion </u></i></b><b><u>, or </u></b><b><i><u>domination </u></i></b><b><u>effect </u></b>.</p>
					<p>The typical NPC aasimar described above is a warrior. Most aasimar favor well-made heavy armor such as plate mail, field plate, or banded mail. They're likely to wear beautifully decorated suits, emblazoned with their coats-of-arms or other such frippery; an aasimar likes to stand tall and proud, and doesn't care who knows it. Because aasimar seem to pick a lot of scraps with powerful evil creatures, they are fond of large weapons that take advantage of their natural strength. An aasimar'll rarely be seen with an assassin's weapon like a hand crossbow or poisoned dagger: they like big two-handed swords, halberds, and maces, and mighty long bows.</p>
					<p>About 25% of all aasimar are priests or fighter-priests, with the spell abilities of a 3rd-level cleric. About 10% more are mages of 3rd to 7th level, with four-sided Hit Dice. Aasimar mages do not gain the 10% magic resistance of the race.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>As noted above, aasimar prefer to blend in with their neighbors and form no independent societies. They tend to be great travelers and wanderers, since they are welcomed anywhere on the Upper Planes and can pass without notice in most other places. Some aaslmar set themselves up as traders and merchants; these cutters do a good business, since everyone <i>knows </i>they're trustworthy. In fact, when an aasimar bobs some sod, he's likely to get away with it since most people'll take his word over his victim's.</p>
					<p>Aasimar commonly intermarry with the people around them: in fact, it's rare to find an aasimar bloodline more than four or five generations old. Unlike tieflings, aasimar are rarely outcasts or orphans. Instead, they usually have the benefit of a respectable upbringing on the side of their moral parent. On rare occasions, aasimar are born into primc-material worlds where no one knows their true heritage. In these settings, the young aasimar often becomes a great leader or hero.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Aasimar's expertise at fitting in with their settings makes them model citizens. They are upright and honest in their dealings, live clean and moral lives, and aren't afraid to stand up for what's right. This is all fine on the Upper Planes, but in neutral places like the Outlands it means that aasimar are born troublemakers. They've got an uncanny ability to ferret out underhanded schemes and put a stop to them. Aasimar're as safe as the next body on their native planes, but in Sigil they've got to watch their step and curb their impulses.</p>
					<p>Aasimar can eat about anything a civilized human can. They have little liking for raw meat, fiery brews, or other such falre. Most aasimar have very discriminating palates and enjoy only the finest viands and wines of mortals.</p>
					<p>There's a natural rivalry between tieflings and aasimar. Tieflings heartily resent them because their mixed heritage isn't perceived as a fault like the tieflings' own commonly is. To the tiefling mind, an aasimar is a coddled half-breed who's had everything handed lo him on a silver plate. Assimar find it difficult not to be suspicious of tieflings in return.</p>

					<p><b>Telepathy - </b><i>Sciences: </i>mind link, mass domination; <i>Devotion: </i>false sensory input.</p>
					<p>The aboleth is a loathsome amphibious creature that lives in subterranean caves and lakes. It despises most land-dwelling creatures and seeks to enslave intelligent surface beings. It is as cruel as it is intelligent.</p>
					<p>An aboleth resembles a plump fish, 20 feet in length from its bulbous head to its fluke-like tail. Its body is blue-green with gray splotches, and its pink-tan underbelly conceals a toothless, rubbery mouth. Three slit-like eyes, purple-red in color and protected by bony ridges, are set one atop the other in the front of its head. Four pulsating blue-black orifices line the bottom of its body and secrete gray slime that smells like rancid grease. Four leathery tentacles, each 10 feet in length, grow from its head. An aboleth uses its tail to propel itself through the water and its tentacles to drag itself along dry land.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>The aboleth attacks with its tentacles for <b>1d6 points of damage </b>each. <b><u>If a victim struck by a tentacle fails a saving throw vs. spell, the victim's skin transforms into a clear, slimy membrane in 1d4+1 rounds </u></b>. If this occurs, the victim must keep the membrane damp with cool water or suffer <b>1d12 points of damage </b>each turn. <i>Cure disease </i>cast upon the victim before the membrane completely forms stops the transformation. Otherwise, <i>cure serious wounds </i>will cause the membrane to revert to normal skin. Because its sluggish movement makes attacks difficult, the aboleth attempts to lure victims close by creating realistic illusions at will, complete with audible, olfactory, and other sensory components. The aboleth can attempt to enslave creatures within 30 feet; it can make three attempts per day, one creature per attempt. <b><u>If the victim fails a saving throw vs. spell, he follows all of the aboleth's telepathic commands, although the victim will not fight on the aboleth's behalf </u></b>. The enslavement can be negated by <i>remove curse </i>, <i>dispel magic, </i>the death of the enslaving aboleth, or, if the victim is separated from the aboleth by more than a mile, a new saving throw (one attempt per day.)</p>
					<p>When underwater, an aboleth surrounds itself with a mucous cloud 1 foot thick. <b><u>A victim in contact with the cloud and inhaling the mucus must roll a successful saving throw vs. poison or lose the ability to breathe air </u></b>. The victim is then able to breathe water, as if having consumed a <i>potion of water breathing </i>, for 1-3 hours. This ability may be renewed by additional contact with the mucous cloud. An affected victim attempting to breathe air will suffocate in 2d6 rounds. Wine or soap dissolves the mucus.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>An aboleth brood consists of a parent and one to three offspring. Though the offspring are as large and as strong as the parent, they defer to the parent in all matters and obey it implicitly. Aboleth have both male and female sexual organs. A mature aboleth reproduces once every five years by concealing itself in a cavern or other remote area, then laying a single egg and covering it in slime. The parent aboleth guards the egg while the embryo grows and develops, a process that takes about five years. A newborn aboleth takes about 10 years to mature.</p>
					<p>The aboleth spends most of its time searching for slaves, preferably human ones. It is rumored that the aboleth use their slaves to construct huge underwater cities, though none have ever been found. The aboleth are rumored to know ancient, horrible secrets that predate the existence of man, but these rumors are also unsubstantiated. There is no doubt that aboleth retain a staggering amount of knowledge. An offspring acquires all of its parent's knowledge at birth, and a mature aboleth acquires the knowledge of any intelligent being it consumes.</p>
					<p>An aboleth's treasure consists of items taken from its slaves. The items are buried in caverns under a layer of slime resembling gray mud, recognizable by the distinctive rancid grease odor.</p>

					<p>The body of an Achaierai looks like a huge spherical head, with a powerful beak, feathered crest and stunted wings. Four metallic legs, each 8-9' long, extend from the underside and end in strong taloned feet. The legs are a metallic blue-gray, the head-body a dull scarlet mottled with deep red. The crest can be of almost any color, but the most common is a bright flame red.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>The birdlike Achaierai attack fearlessly, never needing to check morale if in a flock. However. individuals will attempt to flee if they lose a leg. Though flightless, Achaierai can often elude pursuers because of their speed.</p>
					<p>Only damage to the soft and vulnerable body of an Achaierai will slay it. A single attack on a leg with an edged weapon. which causes at least 15 hp of damage, will sever a leg. Multiple attacks of any type causing 15 hp or more damage to a single leg will render the leg useless, but will not sever it. Area effect attacks will damage all legs within the area affected only if the creature fails its save against the attack. The loss of one leg does not affect its movement rate, but the loss of two will reduce its movement by half.</p>
					<p>If an Achaierai loses three legs or is otherwise seriously wounded, it will release a cloud of poisonous black smoke in approximately a 10' radius sphere. <b><u>All creatures within the cloud (except Achaierai) take 2-12 points of damage </u></b><u>and must save vs. poison or suffer insanity for three hours (treat as a </u><i><u>feeblemind </u></i><u>spell) </u>. The injured bird will attempt to flee in the confusion, crawling at a movement rate of 2 if three legs have been lost. An injures leg will heal fully in one or two days, but these birds do not possess other regenerative powers and a severed leg will not be regrown.</p>
					<p>A flock of Achaierai will attack in an organized manner, often attacking first those opponents they deem to be the most dangerous. No more than two can attack a man-sized creature at one time. Opponents who are man-sized or smaller are usually not able to reach the body of the Achaierai to attack it. Likewise, the bird cannot normally attack these opponents with its beak and will instead fight with two claws.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>These foul birds originate from some ages-old infernal lower plane. The entire race was summoned to this plane long ago for some long-forgotten evil purpose. and none now exist on any other known plane. Though unable to breed on this plane. they are extremely long-lived, and remnants of the original flocks still exist. These creatures roam in dark, unexplored areas underground, attacking all they meet, perhaps still seeking to carry out the commands of their long-dead summoners.</p>
					<p>Achaierai are almost always bound underground, except for rare sightings at night, when they may venture out into the shadowy entrance area of their large cavern complexes. They will often use an area with several small chambers as a 'nesting area'. Though no longer fertile, these birds pair for life and will attack with great ferocity (+2 to hit) if their mates or nesting sites are threatened.</p>
					<p>Though they organize into small flocks and mating pairs, Achaierai have no true society and will turn on each other in hard times, attacking weaker members of the flock and devouring them. Therefore, when single Achaierai are sighted they will often (40% chance) be birds who have lost one or more legs and are afraid to travel with others of their own kind.</p>
					<p>Rarely, (10% of the time) a flock will have a <i>leader </i>of exceptional size and abilities. These individuals have 60 hp for their bodies and 25 hp for each leg. They are +2 both to hit and on damage and are able to use their toxic smoke breath weapon up to four times per day.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Achaierai are true carnivores, devouring only meat, although they are not at all fussy about the freshness of their meals. Because of their size, they must devour an astounding amount of meat every day, and will resort to scavenging or cannibalism as the need arises. They are feared and hunted by the underground races such as drow and deep gnomes, whose villages and livestock are decimated by the appearance of a flock of ravenous Achaierai. Areas in close proximity to these voracious creatures have generally been picked clean of other living beings.</p>

					<p>The ankheg is a burrowing monster usually found in forests or choice agricultural land. Because of its fondness for fresh meat, the ankheg is a threat to any creature unfortunate enough to encounter it.</p>
					<p>The ankheg resembles an enormous many-legged worm. Its six legs end in sharp hooks suitable for burrowing and grasping, and its powerful mandibles are capable of snapping a small tree in half with a single bite. A tough chitinous shell, usually brown or yellow, covers its entire body except for its soft pink belly. The ankheg has glistening black eyes, a small mouth lined with tiny rows of chitinous teeth, and two sensitive antennae that can detect movement of man-sized creatures up to 300 feet away.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>The ankheg's preferred attack method is to lie 5 to 10 feet below the surface of the ground until its antennae detect the approach of a victim. It then burrows up beneath the victim and attempts to grab him in its mandibles, crushing and grinding for <b>3d6 points of damage </b>per round while secreting acidic digestive enzymes to cause an additional <b>1d4 points of damage </b>per round until the victim is dissolved. The ankheg can squirt a stream of acidic enzymes once every six hours to a distance of 30 feet. However, since it is unable to digest food for six hours after it squirts enzymes, it uses this attack technique only when desperate. <b><u>A victim struck by the stream of acidic enzymes suffers 8d4 points of damage </u></b><u>(half damage if the victim rolls a successful saving throw vs. poison) </u>.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>The ankheg uses its mandibles to continuously dig winding tunnels 30-40 feet deep in the rich soil of forests or farmlands. The hollowed end of a tunnel serves as a temporary lair for sleeping, eating, or hibernating. When an ankheg exhausts the food supply in a particular forest or field, it moves on to another.</p>
					<p>Autumn is mating season for ankhegs. After the male fertilizes the female, the female kills him and deposits 2d6 fertilized eggs in his body. Within a few weeks, about 75% of the eggs hatch and begin feeding. In a year, the young ankhegs resemble adults and can function independently. Young ankhegs have 2 Hit Dice and an AC 2 overall and an AC 4 for their undersides; they bite for <b>1d4 points of damage </b>(with an additional <b>1d4 points of damage </b>from enzyme secretions), and spit for <b>4d4 points of damage </b>to a distance of 30 feet. In every year thereafter, the ankheg functions with full adult capabilities and gains an additional Hit Die until it reaches 8 Hit Dice.Beginning in its second year of life, the ankheg sheds its chitinous shell just before the onset of winter. It takes the ankheg two days to shed its old shell and two weeks to grow a new one. During this time, the sluggish ankheg is exceptionally vulnerable. Its overall AC is reduced to 5 and its underside AC is reduced to 7. Additionally, it moves at only half its normal speed, its mandible attack inflicts only <b>1d10 points of damage </b>, and it is unable to squirt acidic enzymes. While growing a new shell, it protects itself by hiding in a deep tunnel and secreting a repulsive fluid that smells like rotten fruit. Though the aroma discourages most creatures, it can also pinpoint the ankheg's location for human hunters and desperately hungry predators.</p>
					<p>Ankhegs living in cold climates hibernate during the winter. Within a month after the first snowfall, the ankheg fashions a lair deep within the warm earth where it remains dormant until spring. The hibernating ankheg requires no food, subsisting instead on nutrients stored in its shell. The ankheg does not secrete aromatic fluid during this time and is thus relatively safe from detection. Though the ankheg's metabolism is reduced, its antennae remain functional, able to alert it to the approach of an intruder. A disturbed ankheg fully awakens in 1d4 rounds, after which time it can attack and move normally.</p>
					<p>The ankheg does not hoard treasure. Items that were not dissolved by the acidic enzymes fall where they drop from the ankheg's mandibles and can be found scattered throughout its tunnel system.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Though a hungry ankheg can be fatal to a farmer, it can be quite beneficial to the farmland. Its tunnel system laces the soil with passages for air and water, while the ankheg's waste products add rich nutrients. The ankheg will eat decayed organic matter in the earth, but it prefers fresh meat. All but the fiercest predators avoid ankhegs. Dried and cured ankheg shells can be made into armor with an AC of 2, and its digestive enzymes can be used as regular acid.</p>

					<p>Giant ants form cooperative colonies in tropical regions. They are normally docile, but they can be fierce fighters if their nest is threatened.</p>
					<p>Giant ants are black, red, or brown. A giant ant's body is covered with by a thick outer skeleton that serves as protection and prevents the body from dehydrating. Two thin antennae sprout from the head and are used for smelling and feeling. An ant's scissor-like mandibles can cut, carry, or dig. Six long legs covered with fine bristles grow from the thorax, while the abdomen contains most of the internal organs.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Both worker and warrior ants will fight. If a warrior ant manages to bite, it will also attempt to sting for <b>3d4 points of damage </b>. <b><u>A successful saving throw vs. poison reduces the sting damage to 1d4 hp </u></b>. The queen ant has 10 Hit Dice but neither moves nor attacks. If she is killed, the remaining ants become confused (as if affected by the spell) for six rounds, then scramble from the nest.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>A giant ant colony makes its nest underground in a series of rooms and passages. Mounds of dirt and twigs mark the entrances. The passages may reach a depth of 16 feet, and the entire nest may be spread out ever an area exceeding several thousand square yards.</p>
					<p>When encountered in the wilderness, there is a 90% chance that all of the ants are workers. Encountered in their colony, there is usually one warrior ant for every five workers; a typical colony consists of 100-200 workers, 20-40 warriors, and a single queen. The warriors are responsible for guarding the queen and defending the nest. All other duties are divided among the workers. Some gather food, some clean the nest, some attend to the developing larvae. Others suck nectar from flowers and produce honey. Storage ants, a special type of worker, swallow the honey until they are too fat to move or work. In times of scarce food, the storage ants expel the honey from their mouths to feed the rest of the colony.</p>
					<p>The queen has no responsibilities other than to lay thousands of eggs per week. Her chamber also contains the colony's treasure, usually shiny jewels the workers collect on hunting expeditions. Nurse ants care for the young in an egg chamber; the larvae hatch and develop into adults in just a few weeks. From 5-50 workers and 5 warriors guard the nursery chamber.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Giant ants prefer to eat seeds and grasses but they will also eat meat if given the opportunity. Neither giant ants nor their eggs have any commercial value, though some gourmets enjoy their honey. In a pinch, giant ants are a good source of protein.</p>
					<p><b>Swarm</b></p>
					<p>There is no sight more fearsome than a swarm of red or golden army ants on the march through a tropical forest, steadily consuming everything in their path. The individual ants resemble smaller versions of giant ants, red or golden in color with powerful mandibles. The swarm is a mobile colony of 3/4'-long workers numbering in the thousands (to determine the number of ants in the swarm, roll 1d10 and multiply the result by 1,500). A single queen, identical to the workers except for her sex and tiny unusable wings, marches in the center the swarm. If the queen is killed, the swarm dissipates.</p>
					<p>The swarm moves in a straight line as a solid block of ants (about 150 ants per square foot). The ants eat all organic matter in their path, including any creatures too, slow to get out of their way. If the ants approach a river or other obstacle, they turn 90 degrees and continue their march. They will not go out of their way to attack and are therefore easy to avoid. <b><u>Any creature in contact with the swarm has a 90% chance per round of suffering 1d6 points of damage </u></b><u>from bites; if bitten, the creature must roll a successful saving throw vs. poison or suffer an additional </u><b><u>1d2 points of damage </u></b><u>from the mild poison </u>. Check for bites and poison for each round the creature is in contact with the swarm. Each point of damage inflicted on the swarm kills 1d20 ants. Ants may be scattered with smoke or like; immersion in water washes them off. If half of a swarm is killed, the surviving ants attempt to scatter and hide; since the ants scatter equally in every direction, this actually increases the possibility a creature in the vicinity may be attacked. If an entire swarm is killed, award 975 experience points per 1,500 ants.</p>

					<p>Aranea are intelligent, forest-dwelling arachnoids that are skilled in magic use. They have two true forms - that of a humanoid and that of a large, intelligent spider - and can shapeshift into a hybrid form that combines the two.</p>
					<p>In <i>humanoid form </i>, an aranea resembles one other creature, from as small as a goblin to as large as a gnoll. Human, elf, and half-elf forms are common. In <i>spider form </i>, an aranea resembles a large spider, hut has an oddly-shaped lump on its back that houses its brain. Beneath its impressive mandibles, sprouting from the front of its body, are two small limbs, each about two feet long. Each of the small limbs has four fingers plus a single thumb (the fingers are many-jointed and the thumb has an extra joint). The <i>hybrid form </i>is humanoid with arachnid elements: fangs, two spinnerets (in the palm of each hand), and four eyes (the second pair often in the temples). Each finger and thumb typically has an extra joint as well. No two aranea have exactly the same hybrid form.</p>
					<p>Most aranea are neutral, thoueh most others think them to be evil. Aranea have infravision with a range of 60 feet. Aranea have their own lanruage and each knows the native Lmguage of the race they emulate.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Araneas prefer to avoid physical combat when possible, relying instead on magical abilities. In arachnid form, they wait in trees for prey to pass underneath; then, they lower themselves silently on web strands and attack with spells. A victim attacked in this manner suffers a -1 penalty to surprise rolls. In humanoid or demispider form, araneas battle as per the emulated race.</p>
					<p>Each aranea is considered to be at least a 3rd-level mage. (Araneas retain the 8-sided Hit Die up to this level, then using the appropriate Hit Die for their class.) This represents their natural relationship with magic and their initial years of training. Most are specialist wizards, preferring illusions and charms but avoiding fire-based spells. Araneas can cast spells in any of their three forms. To avoid arousing suspicion, araneas living among other humanoids keep their spellcasting abilities secret unless they are posing as mages. Most araneas do continue to pursue the magical practices - at least in private - and are higher than 3rd level. Many araneas become multi-class mages, gaining the additional benefit of swordplay or thieving abilities. Single-class thieves are not uncommon, but single-class clerics or fighters are very rare. Even as a single-class character, though, an aranea still retains its abilities as a third-level mage. This is considered more a dual-class than multi-class.</p>
					<p>If forced into physical combat, an adult aranea can attempt to bite and inject venom into an opponent. This can only be accomplished in spider or demispider form and requires a successful attack roll. <b><u>A victim who fails a saving throw vs. poison immediately feels a faint stiffness in his limbs and takes 1d4 points of damage </u></b><u>per round for 1d4 rounds, cumulative for each successful bite </u>. The aranean venom loses potency after a short time, so it cannot be saved and used on weapons.</p>
					<p>Upon reaching maturity, araneas can also learn to spin webs. As with the poisonous bite, an aranea can spin or climb webs only while in arachnid or demispider form. This ability does not make araneas <b><u>immune to the web spell </u></b>. An aranea can produce up to 10 feet of webbing per level per day - half from each spinneret. Web strands measure 1/2 inch in diameter and are strong enough to support approximately 500 pounds. Entangling an opponent with a web requires a normal attack roll. Severing a strand requires only 2 points of cutting damage (which must be inflicted in a single blow) or a successful open doors roll. Immobilizing a man-sized creature requires at least 20 feet of webbing, but considerably less is needed to entangle.</p>
					<p>Araneas wear armor only if allowed by class. In humanoid form they have a base AC of 10. In arachnid form, they have an Armor Class of 7. If an aranea shifts into arachnid form while wearing armor, it takes damage equal to 10 points minus the AC value of the armor. Magical armor must also be removed unless it has the power to alter its size. In this case, the armor expands enough for the aranea to slip out of it during transformation.</p>
					<p>Araneas possess 60-foot infravision and the ability to change form. The aranean shapechanging ability is natural, and young araneas have complete control within a few weeks of birth. Though not physically limited by a specific number of transformations per day, an aranea trying to maintain secrecy will never assume arachnid or demispider form among nonaranea. It requires 1 round to shift between arachnid and demispider or demispider and humanoid. Thus, changing from humanoid to arachnid or the reverse takes a minimum of 2 rounds. The demispider form is merely transitionary and can never be maintained for more than 2 rounds per level.</p>
					<p>An aranea in humanoid form effectively becomes a member of the emulated race and possesses any special abilities that the race has to offer: hearing, special vision, familiarity with tunnels, etc.</p>
					<p>The aranean shapechanging ability gives each aranea two true forms. For this reason, the creature's true race cannot be determined unless someone actually sees the transformation, can read the aranea's mind, or possesses some other extraordinary means. Even a <i>true seeing </i>spell is useless unless the aranea is in demispider form; if this happens, there is an equal chance that it will reveal either the aranea's humanoid or arachnid form. Since the <i>identify species </i>spell was originally invented by the araneas, it is useless against them. Though the shapechanging ability was originally gained through arcane means, neither form is truly magical, so a <i>dispel magic </i>cast on the aranea while it is in humanoid form will not cause it to revert to its arachnid form. If successfully cast on the demispider form (using the aranea's level or Hit Dice as the value of the opposing caster), there is an equal chance that the aranea will revert to its humanoid or arachnid form.</p>
					<p>The shapechanging ability gives araneas partial <b><u>immunity to </u></b><b><i><u>polymorph </u></i></b><b><u>spells, as with lycanthropes and doppelgangers </u></b>. They can resume their normal form after being affected by the spell for 1 round. However, weapons designed to battle shapechangers are also more effective against araneas (as with a <i>sword +1, +3 versus lycanthropes and shapechangers </i>). Shapechanging does not restore any lost hit points and, if killed, the aranea remains in the form held just before death.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Araneas prefer to live in forests, the natural home of their ancestors, where they can hunt and hide. They are the secret rulers of the Magiocracy of Herath, where the cities and villages resemble those of neighboring lands, though with a more diverse mixture of races.</p>
					<p>Araneas take great pains to conceal their dual nature, partly because of the unjust animosity felt toward them by other races. From birth, they are taught that they have two distinct identities. Individuals are forced to keep these two identities separate, never to reveal the secret to other races. Those who do are considered traitors; they are dealt with harshly and quickly by other araneas.</p>
					<p>Due to old legends of their purported evil, araneas are almost universally despised as a sort of <i>bogeyman </i>. A revealed aranea will most likely be hunted down by everyone in the area - especially other araneas. The pose of a <i>tame </i>aranea who has <i>converted to the cause of good </i>may be possible, but it would still be hunted by other araneas.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Araneas use magic to subdue their environment, shaping it to fit their desires. For this reason they can never resist magical items and will go to any extremes to obtain them. They are predators, and many enjoy the flesh of sentient beings, though these are the exception rather than the rule. Araneas are generally talented in cloth production and naturally dominate the silk market with the silk they produce.</p>
					<p>Most araneas feel superior to other races due to their long history and special abilities. They can be cold, calculating, and secretive, but they are rarely evil. They also tend to be suspicious of others, expecting them to have secrets as well. Currently, these shapeshifters get along with the nearby races.</p>

					<p>The petitioners of Mount Celestia, archons have charged themselves with the protection of the plane and all those who are innocent or free of evil within its breathtaking vistas. When a lawful-good mortal dies, his spirit goes to this plane (frequently called the Seven Heavens by prime-material adventurers). There his essence is transformed into the body of a lantern archon, the lowest of the celestial hierarchy. However, not all lawful-good spirits are changed into archons. Some, like dwarves and halflings, become petitioners in the realms of their powers, physically unaltered.</p>
					<p>Seven types of archons populate the seven layers of Mount Celestia. Each has a radically different appearance (as is evidenced by the illustrations in this entry), though all radiate an aura of goodness, peace, and law. Only when threatened or in baffle do archons lose this calm aura.</p>
					<p>As both petitioners and guardians of Mount Celestia, archons are doubly vested in protecting their home from invasion, whether it is by the forces of Mechanus or Baator (two planes whose residents long to control the orderly Mount). Archons abhor combat, but when they must fight they do so with a vengeance. With ire glinting in their eyes, archons willingly enter battle against those who would despoil their plane. Simply entering a fray they are intimidating sights, hut they become even more so when they send forth their aura of extreme menace. <b><u>Those who feel this aura must save versus spell (at +1 for lantern, no modifier for hound, -1 for warden, -2 for sword, -3 for trumpet, -4 for throne, -5 for tome) or suffer a -2 penalty to each attack roll until they successfully hit the archon, at which point the menacing aura disappears </u></b>.</p>
					<p>In addition to creating this aura, all archons can use one of the following abilities once per round at will (unless otherwise stated):</p>
					<list>
						<li>Continual light</li>
						<li>Detect evil</li>
						<li>Infravision</li>
						<li>Protection from evil, 10-foot radius (always active)</li>
						<li>Teleportation without error</li>
						<li>Tongues (always active)</li>
					</list>
					<p>Although a person can guess an archon's station merely by its appearance, there's an equally simple way to judge it: by which metal accoutrements adorn the archon. This ornamentation serves a twofold purpose. First, the items worn indicate whether it is a hound, warden, or whatever. The text on each type of archon indicates if it wears a collar, bracers or greaves, breastplate, helmet, or some combination thereof.</p>
					<p>Second, the quality of the metal shows an archon's virtue within its station. From lowest to highest, the order is lead, tin, brass, bronze, silver, gold, and platinum. For example, platinum rather than brass accoutrements on a warden archon signify its greater obedience to the higher order - its virtue, if you will - and its greater willingness to serve Law and Good. Once it reaches a still higher stage of goodness, it will be transformed into a sword archon wearing lead appointments; it will start the process of advancement all over again in its new station. A visitor to Mount Celestia is likely to see any number of archons of a given station, each wearing different metals.</p>
					<p>When an archon reaches the next state of goodness, it is not fitted with new metal accoutrements; rather, the metal simply transmogrifies into the next state. Because the metal is actually part of an archon's body and cannot be removed, it's unaffected by anything that might change normal metal - including metal-altering spells. The purpose of the metal appointments isn't to confine or hinder or even protect, but to remind the archon of its station so that it might strive to its next level.</p>
					<p>All archons of a given station are equal, regardless of whether they have lead or gold accoutrements. The especially virtuous (those with precious metals) command just as many lower archons as do the new or less virtnous (those with base metals). There's no difference within a station except that a more virtuous member rises to the next rank (or metal) faster. There's also no jealousy among archons, and there's almost never been a recorded instance of one turning stag on its brethren in order to advance. The one archon who did turn stag decided he was better off in Baator, where baatezu reward a being for manipulation and scheming; rumor has it he's clawed his way up to gelugon status now. No, on Mount Celestia archons are rewarded for good and virtuous behavior, and that means they're content to stay in their forms until they advance. Nevertheless, it's a joyous day when either body or metal changes.</p>
					<p>Given the archons' absorption in the philosophy of goodness and law, it's not surprising that they don't covet treasure. They are beyond accumulating worldly goods, seeking only to gain treasures of another sort: celestial understanding, compassion, and so forth. They don't accept money, nor do they bargain with it. Even extremely rare magical items hold no lure for archons.</p>
					<p><b>Lantern Archon</b></p>
					<p>Lanterns, lowest of archons, appear as floating balls of light. They are the equivalent of the infantry in prime-material armies. Newly arrived to Mount Celestia, these petitioners struggle to prove their worth in order to advance in station. However, their desire is not so much advancement as a longing to help those in need. Alone of archons, they bear no metal appointments.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>In combat, lantern archons fire rays of light twice a round at their foes. Those who are pure of heart and intend no harm to an archon are unaffected by the rays, while others suffer <b>1d6 points of damage </b>per hit. The range is 30 feet, with no modifiers.</p>
					<p><b><u>Because of their incorporeal nature, lantern archons aren't hurt by nonmagical weapons, and even magical weapons cause only half damage </u></b>. Lanterns are affected by magic, however, though they are <b><u>immune to paralyzation and </u></b><b><i><u>charm </u></i></b><b><u>spells </u></b>. Likewise, spells that require a corporeal body to cast a spell upon are ineffective against these archons.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Lanterns are very friendly, often helping neophyte adventurers. (Accordingly, they're a perfect introduction to Mount Celestia for prime-material player characters.) As incorporeal beings, however, they can't do much physically to help travelers. Instead, they act as sources of information about Mount Celestia, as guides to the plane, or as fonts of inspiration (often in the form of parables and metaphors).</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>The most common archon, lanterns are typically found only on the first layer of Mount Celestia. There they absorb the light and essence of the plane, needing nothing more to sustain them. Sometimes they serve as messengers to the upper layers, and they can teleport to wherever needed when summoned by a hound archon. Their only goal is to reach the next station of goodness - that of the hounds.</p>
					<p><b>Hound Archon</b></p>
					<p>Hound archons are powerfully muscled humans who have canine heads. Their broad shoulders and large fists mark them as able hand-to-hand combatants; likewise, their strong legs indicate that fleeing enemies might not get very far before being brought down. The hounds are the guardians of the first and second layers, and they command the lantern archons in the defense of Mount Celestia. They wear simple metal collars.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Like most other archons, hounds fight only to defend Mount Celestia or themselves. If the cause is just, or the defendant innocent of evil, hound archons will also defend those who are unable to protect themselves against a mightier foe. Regardless of their motivation for battle, hounds fight with a will. When they attack, they can use weapons, though they prefer their natural abilities. The fists cause <b>1d4 points of damage </b>each, while their fierce bite causes 1d8 points.</p>
					<p>Hounds can also <i>shape change </i>into any type of dog or wolf, though they can't take the form of a lycanthrope. While in their animal form, they can use any of its natural abilities, as well as all of their own. They are <b><u>immune to nonmagical weapons - regardless of which form they are in </u></b>.</p>
					<p>Each hound archon has a telepathic link to 100 lantern archons. Whenever there's trouble, a hound can spread the message via its lanterns (which pass the word quickly indeed). If a hound ever enters combat, it can expect 1d10 lanterns to arrive each round until all 100 are gathered.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Guardians of the lanterns and of the first and second layers of Mount Celestia, hounds also serve as planar hosts. Much like the helpful lanterns, the hound archons welcome travelers to Mount Celestia. They will gladly direct a planewalker to where he wants to go - though often with a watchful eye.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Hound archons can eat anything set before them, as long as it's organic. They have no preference for meat or plant matter, and neither affects them adversely. Interestingly, they don't hunt for meat or harvest vegetation, preferring instead to subsist on gifts of food offered by visitors. Hounds can live indefinitely until the next offering, perhaps subsisting on the remnants of planar essence gleaned as lanterns. They lose this ability once they have metamorphosed to the next station of goodness - that of warden.</p>
					<p><b>Warden Archon</b></p>
					<p>Wardens are best described as hulking humans with grizzly-bear heads. Their hands, though human-shaped, end in claws. Their eyes, tiny and bright like a bear's, reflect extreme intelligence. They have the great strength and acute senses of a grizzly bear, though not its unpredictable nature. Wardens converse via telepathy, though they can (and often do) communicate vocally with ursine animals. They wear collars and arm bracers.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Warden archons are never surprised - at least on Mount Celestia. Since they've never been encountered beyond that plane's borders, it's still dark as to whether they can be surprised elsewhere. Furthermore, they've been known to play stupid in order to draw an enemy near, often confusing a clueless onlooker into thinking the wardens might not be so smart (the enemy, of course, quickly discovers otherwise).</p>
					<p>If said enemy is foolish enough to approach, thinking himself undetected, the warden archon attacks as if it were a bear. Each hand delivers <b>1d8 points of damage </b>, and its powerful bite causes 2d6 more. If both hands hit in a single round, the warden grabs its enemy and wraps him in a powerful hug. This hug delivers 1d10 points of additional damage, allowing the warden to make its bite attack at +4. To break free, a victim must make a successful bend bars/lift gates roll. Until he breaks free, he cannot use his arms or hands for combat - nor can he cast any spells.</p>
					<p>Wardens have access to the lesser/greater divination schools of wizards as well as spells from the priestly divination sphere. A warden can cast any spell of 4th level or lower as if it were an 8th-level priest. Although any given spell can be cast only once per day, the warden can cast at will.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Wardens are the guardians of the portals between Mount Celestia's layers. These archons prevent unworthy cutters and unauthorized travelers from passing through. Likewise, they prevent lanterns from journeying upward through the layers, though they grant dispensation to those lanterns relaying messages.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Unlike grizzly bears, which devour virtually any edible foodstuffs, warden archons are herbivores. They are prodigious eaters, consuming any roots, vegetation, shrubbery, and even trees found in their home. However, they eat only for one hour at the break of day, and they will forgo this repast if need be. Some sages speculate that the warden archons' tremendous consumption is in preparation for their next station, for sword archons consume nothing.</p>
					<p><b>Sword Archon</b></p>
					<p>Sword archons appear as mostly ordinary humans - except most ordinary humans don't have wings in place of arms. Their hair is silvery, and their eyes glow with inner light. They wear collars, leg greaves, and breastplates.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Sword archons can attack four times per round with their powerful bite, inflicting <b>2d4 points of damage </b>for each successhl hit. Swords can also dive to attack, if they have 100 feet in which to move. This attack causes <b>2d10 points of damage </b>. While diving, its AC is -8 because of its great speed. Swords can also cast spells at will from any priest sphere as if they were 15th-level priests.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Swords carry messages from tome archons (and sometimes from the powers themselves) to all of Mount Celestia's layers. These missives proclaim the word of the higher ranking archons - usually gems of wisdom disseminated for the benefit of lower-level archons. Thus, the arrival of a sword is always regarded with some anticipation, even if the message is of impending war.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Sword archons aren't known to consume anything.</p>
					<p><b>Trumpet Archon</b></p>
					<p>Trumpet archons look much like avariel, or winged elves, save that trumpets are even more fair. Each archon of this type wears a collar and breastplate. Each also carries a single silver trumpet, which it blows to announce its arrival upon reaching any destination and upon its return to Mount Celestia. The sound emitted from this trumpet is one of utter clarity and piercing beauty. <b><u>Nonarchons who hear the trumpet must save versus spell; failure means paralyzation for 1d4 rounds </u></b>.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Though they disdain combat, trumpet archons are highly capable warriors. Their trumpets instantly change to silver <i>swords +3 </i>, which they use to attack twice per round for <b>1d10 points of damage </b>for each successful hit. If an archon's trumpet is stolen (in either trumpet or sword form), it transforms into a useless chunk of lead - and woe betide the poor thief should the archon discover him!</p>
					<p>Trumpet archons can also cast spells from all priest spheres as if they were 17th-level priests.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Trumpet archons serve as the messengers of higher archons and the powers, but they also have a far more dangerous duty: They escort the spirit of a newly dead being back to its body if it's resurrected or raised. In performing this duty, the trumpets - alone of all archons - are free to leave the confines of Mount Celestia. Thus, they are held in some awe by their brethren.</p>
					<p>Interestingly, trumpets are the only archon group in which one rules over others of the same station. Israfel, a trumpet, is known as the lord of heralds. He assigns the other trumpets to their duties.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Trumpets consume only mead. Unlike the mortal version, the mead trumpets drink is made from the flowering plants of Mount Celestia. It is exceptionally potent stuff. Legend has it that this mead enhances longevity, though that may only be rumor.</p>
					<p><b>Throne Archon</b></p>
					<p>A metal-clad human, with golden skin and fair hair, best describes the appearance of a typical throne archon. These archons wear helmets and carry swords, and they are protected by breastplates that radiate light.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Throne archons avoid combat whenever they can, instead sending their minions forth to fight their battles. However, they can cast spells from all wizard schools and priest spheres as if they were 18th level. They can also attack twice per round with their powerful <i>vorpal swords +5 </i>, causing Id12 points of damage with each successful attack.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>These archons rule the cities and realms of Mount Celestia; as such, they've got considerable influence, both spiritual and temporal. Indeed, they are said to he the true rulers of the archons, though the tome archons technically rule over more area as each is assigned to a single layer. However, the thrones are more involved with the day-to-day cares of a lawful reign, mediating disputes, resolving conflicts, and exemplifying goodness. Thrones do not politically squabble, instead gathering peacefully to negotiate differences. They can command any archon who falls into their purview.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Throne archons rank only slightly below the tomes. Thrones subsist entirely on nectar, which is derived from combining the praise of lower archons with the celestial fruits found in the Seventh Heaven. They consume no other food.</p>
					<p><b>Tome Archon</b></p>
					<p>Tome archons, the rulers of the seven layers, look like winged humans with hawk heads. Their bodies are covered with armor - a point to remember, for their primary duty is to defend. If necessary, however, they will take the initiative and attack first in an effort to prevent further warfare.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Like the throne archons, tome archons despise fighting personally, though with the tomes its also a matter of global prudence, as opposed to purely personal. Since there are only seven known tomes, their deaths would spell disaster for the archon hierarchy. Therefore, whenever needed, a tome archon can summon 1,000 lanterns, 500 hounds, 250 wardens, or 125 swords to its defense. If necessary, the tome can defend itself by firing rays of light from its hands, twice per round, for <b>1d10 points of damage </b>each. A tome can also cast spells from any priest sphere as if it were a 20th-level priest.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>The seven tome archons are each responsible for a single layer of Mount Celestia. These archons oversee the layers with near-omniscience, though they're unaware of what transpires in the realms of the powers. It's said that the tomes meet to discuss the affairs of the plane, but of course lesser creatures aren't allowed in or near these meetings, so perhaps that's conjecture.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Tomes subsist on ambrosia, the distilled joy of all petitioners on the Mount.</p>
					<p><b>Fallen Archons</b></p>
					<p>Of course, not every archon is perfect. Sometimes they stumble and fall from the path they've chosen; sometimes they choose to reject the ways of archons; and sometimes they are ejected from the celestial ranks by their brethren. It all depends on the magnitude of the transgression. Since archons are naturally forgiving creatures, it takes some incredible foolishness for an archon to fall completely from the grace of Mount Celestia, never to return.</p>
					<p>Those who do fall retain their forms and capabilities, but they do not keep the mystical powers afforded them by the plane. Thus, a hound archon would keep its fists and its appearance, but would lose the ability to summon lantern archons to its aid. In addition, it would be forced to remain in its humanoid form, never again to change shape.</p>
					<p>Naturally, the higher levels of archons fall less frequently, but it's known to happen. Those who show no sign of ridding themselves of chaos are given over to the chaotic powers to become asuras, while the spirits of those who've got evil tainting are banished to the Prime, Sigil, or elsewhere</p>

					<p>The petitioners of Mount Celestia, archons have charged themselves with the protection of the plane and all those who are innocent or free of evil within its breathtaking vistas. When a lawful-good mortal dies, his spirit goes to this plane (frequently called the Seven Heavens by prime-material adventurers). There his essence is transformed into the body of a lantern archon, the lowest of the celestial hierarchy. However, not all lawful-good spirits are changed into archons. Some, like dwarves and halflings, become petitioners in the realms of their powers, physically unaltered.</p>
					<p>Seven types of archons populate the seven layers of Mount Celestia. Each has a radically different appearance (as is evidenced by the illustrations in this entry), though all radiate an aura of goodness, peace, and law. Only when threatened or in baffle do archons lose this calm aura.</p>
					<p>As both petitioners and guardians of Mount Celestia, archons are doubly vested in protecting their home from invasion, whether it is by the forces of Mechanus or Baator (two planes whose residents long to control the orderly Mount). Archons abhor combat, but when they must fight they do so with a vengeance. With ire glinting in their eyes, archons willingly enter battle against those who would despoil their plane. Simply entering a fray they are intimidating sights, hut they become even more so when they send forth their aura of extreme menace. <b><u>Those who feel this aura must save versus spell (at +1 for lantern, no modifier for hound, -1 for warden, -2 for sword, -3 for trumpet, -4 for throne, -5 for tome) or suffer a -2 penalty to each attack roll until they successfully hit the archon, at which point the menacing aura disappears </u></b>.</p>
					<p>In addition to creating this aura, all archons can use one of the following abilities once per round at will (unless otherwise stated):</p>
					<list>
						<li>Continual light</li>
						<li>Detect evil</li>
						<li>Infravision</li>
						<li>Protection from evil, 10-foot radius (always active)</li>
						<li>Teleportation without error</li>
						<li>Tongues (always active)</li>
					</list>
					<p>Although a person can guess an archon's station merely by its appearance, there's an equally simple way to judge it: by which metal accoutrements adorn the archon. This ornamentation serves a twofold purpose. First, the items worn indicate whether it is a hound, warden, or whatever. The text on each type of archon indicates if it wears a collar, bracers or greaves, breastplate, helmet, or some combination thereof.</p>
					<p>Second, the quality of the metal shows an archon's virtue within its station. From lowest to highest, the order is lead, tin, brass, bronze, silver, gold, and platinum. For example, platinum rather than brass accoutrements on a warden archon signify its greater obedience to the higher order - its virtue, if you will - and its greater willingness to serve Law and Good. Once it reaches a still higher stage of goodness, it will be transformed into a sword archon wearing lead appointments; it will start the process of advancement all over again in its new station. A visitor to Mount Celestia is likely to see any number of archons of a given station, each wearing different metals.</p>
					<p>When an archon reaches the next state of goodness, it is not fitted with new metal accoutrements; rather, the metal simply transmogrifies into the next state. Because the metal is actually part of an archon's body and cannot be removed, it's unaffected by anything that might change normal metal - including metal-altering spells. The purpose of the metal appointments isn't to confine or hinder or even protect, but to remind the archon of its station so that it might strive to its next level.</p>
					<p>All archons of a given station are equal, regardless of whether they have lead or gold accoutrements. The especially virtuous (those with precious metals) command just as many lower archons as do the new or less virtnous (those with base metals). There's no difference within a station except that a more virtuous member rises to the next rank (or metal) faster. There's also no jealousy among archons, and there's almost never been a recorded instance of one turning stag on its brethren in order to advance. The one archon who did turn stag decided he was better off in Baator, where baatezu reward a being for manipulation and scheming; rumor has it he's clawed his way up to gelugon status now. No, on Mount Celestia archons are rewarded for good and virtuous behavior, and that means they're content to stay in their forms until they advance. Nevertheless, it's a joyous day when either body or metal changes.</p>
					<p>Given the archons' absorption in the philosophy of goodness and law, it's not surprising that they don't covet treasure. They are beyond accumulating worldly goods, seeking only to gain treasures of another sort: celestial understanding, compassion, and so forth. They don't accept money, nor do they bargain with it. Even extremely rare magical items hold no lure for archons.</p>
					<p><b>Lantern Archon</b></p>
					<p>Lanterns, lowest of archons, appear as floating balls of light. They are the equivalent of the infantry in prime-material armies. Newly arrived to Mount Celestia, these petitioners struggle to prove their worth in order to advance in station. However, their desire is not so much advancement as a longing to help those in need. Alone of archons, they bear no metal appointments.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>In combat, lantern archons fire rays of light twice a round at their foes. Those who are pure of heart and intend no harm to an archon are unaffected by the rays, while others suffer <b>1d6 points of damage </b>per hit. The range is 30 feet, with no modifiers.</p>
					<p><b><u>Because of their incorporeal nature, lantern archons aren't hurt by nonmagical weapons, and even magical weapons cause only half damage </u></b>. Lanterns are affected by magic, however, though they are <b><u>immune to paralyzation and </u></b><b><i><u>charm </u></i></b><b><u>spells </u></b>. Likewise, spells that require a corporeal body to cast a spell upon are ineffective against these archons.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Lanterns are very friendly, often helping neophyte adventurers. (Accordingly, they're a perfect introduction to Mount Celestia for prime-material player characters.) As incorporeal beings, however, they can't do much physically to help travelers. Instead, they act as sources of information about Mount Celestia, as guides to the plane, or as fonts of inspiration (often in the form of parables and metaphors).</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>The most common archon, lanterns are typically found only on the first layer of Mount Celestia. There they absorb the light and essence of the plane, needing nothing more to sustain them. Sometimes they serve as messengers to the upper layers, and they can teleport to wherever needed when summoned by a hound archon. Their only goal is to reach the next station of goodness - that of the hounds.</p>
					<p><b>Hound Archon</b></p>
					<p>Hound archons are powerfully muscled humans who have canine heads. Their broad shoulders and large fists mark them as able hand-to-hand combatants; likewise, their strong legs indicate that fleeing enemies might not get very far before being brought down. The hounds are the guardians of the first and second layers, and they command the lantern archons in the defense of Mount Celestia. They wear simple metal collars.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Like most other archons, hounds fight only to defend Mount Celestia or themselves. If the cause is just, or the defendant innocent of evil, hound archons will also defend those who are unable to protect themselves against a mightier foe. Regardless of their motivation for battle, hounds fight with a will. When they attack, they can use weapons, though they prefer their natural abilities. The fists cause <b>1d4 points of damage </b>each, while their fierce bite causes 1d8 points.</p>
					<p>Hounds can also <i>shape change </i>into any type of dog or wolf, though they can't take the form of a lycanthrope. While in their animal form, they can use any of its natural abilities, as well as all of their own. They are <b><u>immune to nonmagical weapons - regardless of which form they are in </u></b>.</p>
					<p>Each hound archon has a telepathic link to 100 lantern archons. Whenever there's trouble, a hound can spread the message via its lanterns (which pass the word quickly indeed). If a hound ever enters combat, it can expect 1d10 lanterns to arrive each round until all 100 are gathered.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Guardians of the lanterns and of the first and second layers of Mount Celestia, hounds also serve as planar hosts. Much like the helpful lanterns, the hound archons welcome travelers to Mount Celestia. They will gladly direct a planewalker to where he wants to go - though often with a watchful eye.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Hound archons can eat anything set before them, as long as it's organic. They have no preference for meat or plant matter, and neither affects them adversely. Interestingly, they don't hunt for meat or harvest vegetation, preferring instead to subsist on gifts of food offered by visitors. Hounds can live indefinitely until the next offering, perhaps subsisting on the remnants of planar essence gleaned as lanterns. They lose this ability once they have metamorphosed to the next station of goodness - that of warden.</p>
					<p><b>Warden Archon</b></p>
					<p>Wardens are best described as hulking humans with grizzly-bear heads. Their hands, though human-shaped, end in claws. Their eyes, tiny and bright like a bear's, reflect extreme intelligence. They have the great strength and acute senses of a grizzly bear, though not its unpredictable nature. Wardens converse via telepathy, though they can (and often do) communicate vocally with ursine animals. They wear collars and arm bracers.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Warden archons are never surprised - at least on Mount Celestia. Since they've never been encountered beyond that plane's borders, it's still dark as to whether they can be surprised elsewhere. Furthermore, they've been known to play stupid in order to draw an enemy near, often confusing a clueless onlooker into thinking the wardens might not be so smart (the enemy, of course, quickly discovers otherwise).</p>
					<p>If said enemy is foolish enough to approach, thinking himself undetected, the warden archon attacks as if it were a bear. Each hand delivers <b>1d8 points of damage </b>, and its powerful bite causes 2d6 more. If both hands hit in a single round, the warden grabs its enemy and wraps him in a powerful hug. This hug delivers 1d10 points of additional damage, allowing the warden to make its bite attack at +4. To break free, a victim must make a successful bend bars/lift gates roll. Until he breaks free, he cannot use his arms or hands for combat - nor can he cast any spells.</p>
					<p>Wardens have access to the lesser/greater divination schools of wizards as well as spells from the priestly divination sphere. A warden can cast any spell of 4th level or lower as if it were an 8th-level priest. Although any given spell can be cast only once per day, the warden can cast at will.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Wardens are the guardians of the portals between Mount Celestia's layers. These archons prevent unworthy cutters and unauthorized travelers from passing through. Likewise, they prevent lanterns from journeying upward through the layers, though they grant dispensation to those lanterns relaying messages.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Unlike grizzly bears, which devour virtually any edible foodstuffs, warden archons are herbivores. They are prodigious eaters, consuming any roots, vegetation, shrubbery, and even trees found in their home. However, they eat only for one hour at the break of day, and they will forgo this repast if need be. Some sages speculate that the warden archons' tremendous consumption is in preparation for their next station, for sword archons consume nothing.</p>
					<p><b>Sword Archon</b></p>
					<p>Sword archons appear as mostly ordinary humans - except most ordinary humans don't have wings in place of arms. Their hair is silvery, and their eyes glow with inner light. They wear collars, leg greaves, and breastplates.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Sword archons can attack four times per round with their powerful bite, inflicting <b>2d4 points of damage </b>for each successhl hit. Swords can also dive to attack, if they have 100 feet in which to move. This attack causes <b>2d10 points of damage </b>. While diving, its AC is -8 because of its great speed. Swords can also cast spells at will from any priest sphere as if they were 15th-level priests.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Swords carry messages from tome archons (and sometimes from the powers themselves) to all of Mount Celestia's layers. These missives proclaim the word of the higher ranking archons - usually gems of wisdom disseminated for the benefit of lower-level archons. Thus, the arrival of a sword is always regarded with some anticipation, even if the message is of impending war.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Sword archons aren't known to consume anything.</p>
					<p><b>Trumpet Archon</b></p>
					<p>Trumpet archons look much like avariel, or winged elves, save that trumpets are even more fair. Each archon of this type wears a collar and breastplate. Each also carries a single silver trumpet, which it blows to announce its arrival upon reaching any destination and upon its return to Mount Celestia. The sound emitted from this trumpet is one of utter clarity and piercing beauty. <b><u>Nonarchons who hear the trumpet must save versus spell; failure means paralyzation for 1d4 rounds </u></b>.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Though they disdain combat, trumpet archons are highly capable warriors. Their trumpets instantly change to silver <i>swords +3 </i>, which they use to attack twice per round for <b>1d10 points of damage </b>for each successful hit. If an archon's trumpet is stolen (in either trumpet or sword form), it transforms into a useless chunk of lead - and woe betide the poor thief should the archon discover him!</p>
					<p>Trumpet archons can also cast spells from all priest spheres as if they were 17th-level priests.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Trumpet archons serve as the messengers of higher archons and the powers, but they also have a far more dangerous duty: They escort the spirit of a newly dead being back to its body if it's resurrected or raised. In performing this duty, the trumpets - alone of all archons - are free to leave the confines of Mount Celestia. Thus, they are held in some awe by their brethren.</p>
					<p>Interestingly, trumpets are the only archon group in which one rules over others of the same station. Israfel, a trumpet, is known as the lord of heralds. He assigns the other trumpets to their duties.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Trumpets consume only mead. Unlike the mortal version, the mead trumpets drink is made from the flowering plants of Mount Celestia. It is exceptionally potent stuff. Legend has it that this mead enhances longevity, though that may only be rumor.</p>
					<p><b>Throne Archon</b></p>
					<p>A metal-clad human, with golden skin and fair hair, best describes the appearance of a typical throne archon. These archons wear helmets and carry swords, and they are protected by breastplates that radiate light.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Throne archons avoid combat whenever they can, instead sending their minions forth to fight their battles. However, they can cast spells from all wizard schools and priest spheres as if they were 18th level. They can also attack twice per round with their powerful <i>vorpal swords +5 </i>, causing Id12 points of damage with each successful attack.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>These archons rule the cities and realms of Mount Celestia; as such, they've got considerable influence, both spiritual and temporal. Indeed, they are said to he the true rulers of the archons, though the tome archons technically rule over more area as each is assigned to a single layer. However, the thrones are more involved with the day-to-day cares of a lawful reign, mediating disputes, resolving conflicts, and exemplifying goodness. Thrones do not politically squabble, instead gathering peacefully to negotiate differences. They can command any archon who falls into their purview.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Throne archons rank only slightly below the tomes. Thrones subsist entirely on nectar, which is derived from combining the praise of lower archons with the celestial fruits found in the Seventh Heaven. They consume no other food.</p>
					<p><b>Tome Archon</b></p>
					<p>Tome archons, the rulers of the seven layers, look like winged humans with hawk heads. Their bodies are covered with armor - a point to remember, for their primary duty is to defend. If necessary, however, they will take the initiative and attack first in an effort to prevent further warfare.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Like the throne archons, tome archons despise fighting personally, though with the tomes its also a matter of global prudence, as opposed to purely personal. Since there are only seven known tomes, their deaths would spell disaster for the archon hierarchy. Therefore, whenever needed, a tome archon can summon 1,000 lanterns, 500 hounds, 250 wardens, or 125 swords to its defense. If necessary, the tome can defend itself by firing rays of light from its hands, twice per round, for <b>1d10 points of damage </b>each. A tome can also cast spells from any priest sphere as if it were a 20th-level priest.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>The seven tome archons are each responsible for a single layer of Mount Celestia. These archons oversee the layers with near-omniscience, though they're unaware of what transpires in the realms of the powers. It's said that the tomes meet to discuss the affairs of the plane, but of course lesser creatures aren't allowed in or near these meetings, so perhaps that's conjecture.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Tomes subsist on ambrosia, the distilled joy of all petitioners on the Mount.</p>
					<p><b>Fallen Archons</b></p>
					<p>Of course, not every archon is perfect. Sometimes they stumble and fall from the path they've chosen; sometimes they choose to reject the ways of archons; and sometimes they are ejected from the celestial ranks by their brethren. It all depends on the magnitude of the transgression. Since archons are naturally forgiving creatures, it takes some incredible foolishness for an archon to fall completely from the grace of Mount Celestia, never to return.</p>
					<p>Those who do fall retain their forms and capabilities, but they do not keep the mystical powers afforded them by the plane. Thus, a hound archon would keep its fists and its appearance, but would lose the ability to summon lantern archons to its aid. In addition, it would be forced to remain in its humanoid form, never again to change shape.</p>
					<p>Naturally, the higher levels of archons fall less frequently, but it's known to happen. Those who show no sign of ridding themselves of chaos are given over to the chaotic powers to become asuras, while the spirits of those who've got evil tainting are banished to the Prime, Sigil, or elsewhere</p>

					<p>The petitioners of Mount Celestia, archons have charged themselves with the protection of the plane and all those who are innocent or free of evil within its breathtaking vistas. When a lawful-good mortal dies, his spirit goes to this plane (frequently called the Seven Heavens by prime-material adventurers). There his essence is transformed into the body of a lantern archon, the lowest of the celestial hierarchy. However, not all lawful-good spirits are changed into archons. Some, like dwarves and halflings, become petitioners in the realms of their powers, physically unaltered.</p>
					<p>Seven types of archons populate the seven layers of Mount Celestia. Each has a radically different appearance (as is evidenced by the illustrations in this entry), though all radiate an aura of goodness, peace, and law. Only when threatened or in baffle do archons lose this calm aura.</p>
					<p>As both petitioners and guardians of Mount Celestia, archons are doubly vested in protecting their home from invasion, whether it is by the forces of Mechanus or Baator (two planes whose residents long to control the orderly Mount). Archons abhor combat, but when they must fight they do so with a vengeance. With ire glinting in their eyes, archons willingly enter battle against those who would despoil their plane. Simply entering a fray they are intimidating sights, hut they become even more so when they send forth their aura of extreme menace. <b><u>Those who feel this aura must save versus spell (at +1 for lantern, no modifier for hound, -1 for warden, -2 for sword, -3 for trumpet, -4 for throne, -5 for tome) or suffer a -2 penalty to each attack roll until they successfully hit the archon, at which point the menacing aura disappears </u></b>.</p>
					<p>In addition to creating this aura, all archons can use one of the following abilities once per round at will (unless otherwise stated):</p>
					<list>
						<li>Continual light</li>
						<li>Detect evil</li>
						<li>Infravision</li>
						<li>Protection from evil, 10-foot radius (always active)</li>
						<li>Teleportation without error</li>
						<li>Tongues (always active)</li>
					</list>
					<p>Although a person can guess an archon's station merely by its appearance, there's an equally simple way to judge it: by which metal accoutrements adorn the archon. This ornamentation serves a twofold purpose. First, the items worn indicate whether it is a hound, warden, or whatever. The text on each type of archon indicates if it wears a collar, bracers or greaves, breastplate, helmet, or some combination thereof.</p>
					<p>Second, the quality of the metal shows an archon's virtue within its station. From lowest to highest, the order is lead, tin, brass, bronze, silver, gold, and platinum. For example, platinum rather than brass accoutrements on a warden archon signify its greater obedience to the higher order - its virtue, if you will - and its greater willingness to serve Law and Good. Once it reaches a still higher stage of goodness, it will be transformed into a sword archon wearing lead appointments; it will start the process of advancement all over again in its new station. A visitor to Mount Celestia is likely to see any number of archons of a given station, each wearing different metals.</p>
					<p>When an archon reaches the next state of goodness, it is not fitted with new metal accoutrements; rather, the metal simply transmogrifies into the next state. Because the metal is actually part of an archon's body and cannot be removed, it's unaffected by anything that might change normal metal - including metal-altering spells. The purpose of the metal appointments isn't to confine or hinder or even protect, but to remind the archon of its station so that it might strive to its next level.</p>
					<p>All archons of a given station are equal, regardless of whether they have lead or gold accoutrements. The especially virtuous (those with precious metals) command just as many lower archons as do the new or less virtnous (those with base metals). There's no difference within a station except that a more virtuous member rises to the next rank (or metal) faster. There's also no jealousy among archons, and there's almost never been a recorded instance of one turning stag on its brethren in order to advance. The one archon who did turn stag decided he was better off in Baator, where baatezu reward a being for manipulation and scheming; rumor has it he's clawed his way up to gelugon status now. No, on Mount Celestia archons are rewarded for good and virtuous behavior, and that means they're content to stay in their forms until they advance. Nevertheless, it's a joyous day when either body or metal changes.</p>
					<p>Given the archons' absorption in the philosophy of goodness and law, it's not surprising that they don't covet treasure. They are beyond accumulating worldly goods, seeking only to gain treasures of another sort: celestial understanding, compassion, and so forth. They don't accept money, nor do they bargain with it. Even extremely rare magical items hold no lure for archons.</p>
					<p><b>Lantern Archon</b></p>
					<p>Lanterns, lowest of archons, appear as floating balls of light. They are the equivalent of the infantry in prime-material armies. Newly arrived to Mount Celestia, these petitioners struggle to prove their worth in order to advance in station. However, their desire is not so much advancement as a longing to help those in need. Alone of archons, they bear no metal appointments.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>In combat, lantern archons fire rays of light twice a round at their foes. Those who are pure of heart and intend no harm to an archon are unaffected by the rays, while others suffer <b>1d6 points of damage </b>per hit. The range is 30 feet, with no modifiers.</p>
					<p><b><u>Because of their incorporeal nature, lantern archons aren't hurt by nonmagical weapons, and even magical weapons cause only half damage </u></b>. Lanterns are affected by magic, however, though they are <b><u>immune to paralyzation and </u></b><b><i><u>charm </u></i></b><b><u>spells </u></b>. Likewise, spells that require a corporeal body to cast a spell upon are ineffective against these archons.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Lanterns are very friendly, often helping neophyte adventurers. (Accordingly, they're a perfect introduction to Mount Celestia for prime-material player characters.) As incorporeal beings, however, they can't do much physically to help travelers. Instead, they act as sources of information about Mount Celestia, as guides to the plane, or as fonts of inspiration (often in the form of parables and metaphors).</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>The most common archon, lanterns are typically found only on the first layer of Mount Celestia. There they absorb the light and essence of the plane, needing nothing more to sustain them. Sometimes they serve as messengers to the upper layers, and they can teleport to wherever needed when summoned by a hound archon. Their only goal is to reach the next station of goodness - that of the hounds.</p>
					<p><b>Hound Archon</b></p>
					<p>Hound archons are powerfully muscled humans who have canine heads. Their broad shoulders and large fists mark them as able hand-to-hand combatants; likewise, their strong legs indicate that fleeing enemies might not get very far before being brought down. The hounds are the guardians of the first and second layers, and they command the lantern archons in the defense of Mount Celestia. They wear simple metal collars.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Like most other archons, hounds fight only to defend Mount Celestia or themselves. If the cause is just, or the defendant innocent of evil, hound archons will also defend those who are unable to protect themselves against a mightier foe. Regardless of their motivation for battle, hounds fight with a will. When they attack, they can use weapons, though they prefer their natural abilities. The fists cause <b>1d4 points of damage </b>each, while their fierce bite causes 1d8 points.</p>
					<p>Hounds can also <i>shape change </i>into any type of dog or wolf, though they can't take the form of a lycanthrope. While in their animal form, they can use any of its natural abilities, as well as all of their own. They are <b><u>immune to nonmagical weapons - regardless of which form they are in </u></b>.</p>
					<p>Each hound archon has a telepathic link to 100 lantern archons. Whenever there's trouble, a hound can spread the message via its lanterns (which pass the word quickly indeed). If a hound ever enters combat, it can expect 1d10 lanterns to arrive each round until all 100 are gathered.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Guardians of the lanterns and of the first and second layers of Mount Celestia, hounds also serve as planar hosts. Much like the helpful lanterns, the hound archons welcome travelers to Mount Celestia. They will gladly direct a planewalker to where he wants to go - though often with a watchful eye.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Hound archons can eat anything set before them, as long as it's organic. They have no preference for meat or plant matter, and neither affects them adversely. Interestingly, they don't hunt for meat or harvest vegetation, preferring instead to subsist on gifts of food offered by visitors. Hounds can live indefinitely until the next offering, perhaps subsisting on the remnants of planar essence gleaned as lanterns. They lose this ability once they have metamorphosed to the next station of goodness - that of warden.</p>
					<p><b>Warden Archon</b></p>
					<p>Wardens are best described as hulking humans with grizzly-bear heads. Their hands, though human-shaped, end in claws. Their eyes, tiny and bright like a bear's, reflect extreme intelligence. They have the great strength and acute senses of a grizzly bear, though not its unpredictable nature. Wardens converse via telepathy, though they can (and often do) communicate vocally with ursine animals. They wear collars and arm bracers.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Warden archons are never surprised - at least on Mount Celestia. Since they've never been encountered beyond that plane's borders, it's still dark as to whether they can be surprised elsewhere. Furthermore, they've been known to play stupid in order to draw an enemy near, often confusing a clueless onlooker into thinking the wardens might not be so smart (the enemy, of course, quickly discovers otherwise).</p>
					<p>If said enemy is foolish enough to approach, thinking himself undetected, the warden archon attacks as if it were a bear. Each hand delivers <b>1d8 points of damage </b>, and its powerful bite causes 2d6 more. If both hands hit in a single round, the warden grabs its enemy and wraps him in a powerful hug. This hug delivers 1d10 points of additional damage, allowing the warden to make its bite attack at +4. To break free, a victim must make a successful bend bars/lift gates roll. Until he breaks free, he cannot use his arms or hands for combat - nor can he cast any spells.</p>
					<p>Wardens have access to the lesser/greater divination schools of wizards as well as spells from the priestly divination sphere. A warden can cast any spell of 4th level or lower as if it were an 8th-level priest. Although any given spell can be cast only once per day, the warden can cast at will.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Wardens are the guardians of the portals between Mount Celestia's layers. These archons prevent unworthy cutters and unauthorized travelers from passing through. Likewise, they prevent lanterns from journeying upward through the layers, though they grant dispensation to those lanterns relaying messages.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Unlike grizzly bears, which devour virtually any edible foodstuffs, warden archons are herbivores. They are prodigious eaters, consuming any roots, vegetation, shrubbery, and even trees found in their home. However, they eat only for one hour at the break of day, and they will forgo this repast if need be. Some sages speculate that the warden archons' tremendous consumption is in preparation for their next station, for sword archons consume nothing.</p>
					<p><b>Sword Archon</b></p>
					<p>Sword archons appear as mostly ordinary humans - except most ordinary humans don't have wings in place of arms. Their hair is silvery, and their eyes glow with inner light. They wear collars, leg greaves, and breastplates.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Sword archons can attack four times per round with their powerful bite, inflicting <b>2d4 points of damage </b>for each successhl hit. Swords can also dive to attack, if they have 100 feet in which to move. This attack causes <b>2d10 points of damage </b>. While diving, its AC is -8 because of its great speed. Swords can also cast spells at will from any priest sphere as if they were 15th-level priests.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Swords carry messages from tome archons (and sometimes from the powers themselves) to all of Mount Celestia's layers. These missives proclaim the word of the higher ranking archons - usually gems of wisdom disseminated for the benefit of lower-level archons. Thus, the arrival of a sword is always regarded with some anticipation, even if the message is of impending war.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Sword archons aren't known to consume anything.</p>
					<p><b>Trumpet Archon</b></p>
					<p>Trumpet archons look much like avariel, or winged elves, save that trumpets are even more fair. Each archon of this type wears a collar and breastplate. Each also carries a single silver trumpet, which it blows to announce its arrival upon reaching any destination and upon its return to Mount Celestia. The sound emitted from this trumpet is one of utter clarity and piercing beauty. <b><u>Nonarchons who hear the trumpet must save versus spell; failure means paralyzation for 1d4 rounds </u></b>.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Though they disdain combat, trumpet archons are highly capable warriors. Their trumpets instantly change to silver <i>swords +3 </i>, which they use to attack twice per round for <b>1d10 points of damage </b>for each successful hit. If an archon's trumpet is stolen (in either trumpet or sword form), it transforms into a useless chunk of lead - and woe betide the poor thief should the archon discover him!</p>
					<p>Trumpet archons can also cast spells from all priest spheres as if they were 17th-level priests.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Trumpet archons serve as the messengers of higher archons and the powers, but they also have a far more dangerous duty: They escort the spirit of a newly dead being back to its body if it's resurrected or raised. In performing this duty, the trumpets - alone of all archons - are free to leave the confines of Mount Celestia. Thus, they are held in some awe by their brethren.</p>
					<p>Interestingly, trumpets are the only archon group in which one rules over others of the same station. Israfel, a trumpet, is known as the lord of heralds. He assigns the other trumpets to their duties.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Trumpets consume only mead. Unlike the mortal version, the mead trumpets drink is made from the flowering plants of Mount Celestia. It is exceptionally potent stuff. Legend has it that this mead enhances longevity, though that may only be rumor.</p>
					<p><b>Throne Archon</b></p>
					<p>A metal-clad human, with golden skin and fair hair, best describes the appearance of a typical throne archon. These archons wear helmets and carry swords, and they are protected by breastplates that radiate light.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Throne archons avoid combat whenever they can, instead sending their minions forth to fight their battles. However, they can cast spells from all wizard schools and priest spheres as if they were 18th level. They can also attack twice per round with their powerful <i>vorpal swords +5 </i>, causing Id12 points of damage with each successful attack.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>These archons rule the cities and realms of Mount Celestia; as such, they've got considerable influence, both spiritual and temporal. Indeed, they are said to he the true rulers of the archons, though the tome archons technically rule over more area as each is assigned to a single layer. However, the thrones are more involved with the day-to-day cares of a lawful reign, mediating disputes, resolving conflicts, and exemplifying goodness. Thrones do not politically squabble, instead gathering peacefully to negotiate differences. They can command any archon who falls into their purview.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Throne archons rank only slightly below the tomes. Thrones subsist entirely on nectar, which is derived from combining the praise of lower archons with the celestial fruits found in the Seventh Heaven. They consume no other food.</p>
					<p><b>Tome Archon</b></p>
					<p>Tome archons, the rulers of the seven layers, look like winged humans with hawk heads. Their bodies are covered with armor - a point to remember, for their primary duty is to defend. If necessary, however, they will take the initiative and attack first in an effort to prevent further warfare.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Like the throne archons, tome archons despise fighting personally, though with the tomes its also a matter of global prudence, as opposed to purely personal. Since there are only seven known tomes, their deaths would spell disaster for the archon hierarchy. Therefore, whenever needed, a tome archon can summon 1,000 lanterns, 500 hounds, 250 wardens, or 125 swords to its defense. If necessary, the tome can defend itself by firing rays of light from its hands, twice per round, for <b>1d10 points of damage </b>each. A tome can also cast spells from any priest sphere as if it were a 20th-level priest.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>The seven tome archons are each responsible for a single layer of Mount Celestia. These archons oversee the layers with near-omniscience, though they're unaware of what transpires in the realms of the powers. It's said that the tomes meet to discuss the affairs of the plane, but of course lesser creatures aren't allowed in or near these meetings, so perhaps that's conjecture.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Tomes subsist on ambrosia, the distilled joy of all petitioners on the Mount.</p>
					<p><b>Fallen Archons</b></p>
					<p>Of course, not every archon is perfect. Sometimes they stumble and fall from the path they've chosen; sometimes they choose to reject the ways of archons; and sometimes they are ejected from the celestial ranks by their brethren. It all depends on the magnitude of the transgression. Since archons are naturally forgiving creatures, it takes some incredible foolishness for an archon to fall completely from the grace of Mount Celestia, never to return.</p>
					<p>Those who do fall retain their forms and capabilities, but they do not keep the mystical powers afforded them by the plane. Thus, a hound archon would keep its fists and its appearance, but would lose the ability to summon lantern archons to its aid. In addition, it would be forced to remain in its humanoid form, never again to change shape.</p>
					<p>Naturally, the higher levels of archons fall less frequently, but it's known to happen. Those who show no sign of ridding themselves of chaos are given over to the chaotic powers to become asuras, while the spirits of those who've got evil tainting are banished to the Prime, Sigil, or elsewhere</p>

					<p>Cornugons are elite defense forces. They look frightening: 9 feet tall, only vaguely humanoid, and covered with grotesque scales. Their huge wings and snaking, prehensile tail add to their intimidating demeanor. In combat they favor a long barbed whip.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Cornugons are fearless fighters, rarely retreating from combat even against overwhelming odds. They have 18/00 Strength (+6 damage adjustment). Cornugons attack with their tail for <b>1d3 points of damage </b>, creating a wound that bleeds 1 point per round until treated. <b><u>In addition, they attack with either claws ( 1d4 points of damage </u></b><u>) and bite ( </u><b><u>1d4+1 points of damage </u></b><u>), or with a barbed whip ( </u><b><u>1d6 points of damage </u></b><u>and save vs. paralyzation or be stunned for 1d4 rounds) </u>.</p>
					<p>In addition to the magical abilities inherent in all baatezu, cornugons can use the spell-like powers <i>detect magic </i>, <i>ESP </i>, <i>lightning bolt </i>(3 times per day), <i>produce flame </i>, <i>pyrotechnics </i>and <i>wall of fire </i>(once per day). They can attempt to <i>gate </i>in the following: 2 to 12 barbazu (50% chance, once per day), 2 to 16 abishai (35% chance, once per day), and 1 to 3 additional cornugons (20% chance, once per day).</p>
					<p>All comugons radiate a <i>fear </i>aura in a 5-foot radius. <b><u>Anyone entering the radius must save vs. rod, staff, or wand or flee in terror for 1d6 melee rounds </u></b>. Cornugons regenerate 2 hit points per melee round.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Cornugons, the elite fighting force in Baator, form terrifying armies up to 2,000 strong. Only pit fiends may lead these hideous fighting forces into battle. Pit fiends and gelugons prize cornugons as personal guardians and try to obtain them as personal retainers. The Dark Eight have 106 cornugons in their retinue.</p>
					<p>Cornugon armies usually form only in the lowest layers of Baator. In the upper layers, individual comugons serve as generals to vast armies of lesser baatezu. This duty is desirable for its rapid advancement, second only to guardian duty among the Dark Eight.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>The cornugons are greater baatezu, and as such enjoy a certain prestige. Of all the baatezu, the cornugons and hamatula advance most rapidly.</p>
					<p>With several successful campaigns to their credit, heroic comugons receive promotions to the upper layer of Baator, where they command vast, gruesome legions of baatezu. From there, distinguished action leads to promotion to gelugons, the ruthless inhabitants of the frigid layer of Caina.</p>
					<p>Although powerful and cunning, the cornugons display treachery in their ranks least often of all baatezu, due to their militaristic nature. Their loyalty makes them an unusual asset. It is said that the 106 cornugons that guard the Dark Eight are completely loyal and would give their lives in defense of the council, behavior nearly unheard of in Baator. Whether this is due to genuine loyalty or fear of the pit fiends is unknown, but seldom in the history of the Dark Eight has a cornugon guardian displayed traitorous behavior.</p>

					<p>Gelugons are ferocious baatezu that live in frigid Caina. They look alien, with 12-foot insectlike bodies, claws on hands and feet, and sharp pincers at the mouth. Their heads bulge with multifaceted eyes. The gelugon has a long, thick tail covered with razor-sharp spikes.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Gelugons are extremely strong, with 18/76 Strength (+4 damage adjustment). They attack four times per round with their two claws ( <b>1d4 points of damage </b>), pincers (2d4 points), and tail (3d4 points and paralysis) instead of weapons. <b><u>The tail radiates cold like the wind of Caina itself: the victim must save vs. paralyzation or be paralyzed by numbing cold for 1d6 rounds </u></b>. The gelugon may direct each of its four attacks against a different opponent.</p>
					<p>One in four gelugons carries a long spear ( <b>2d6 points of damage </b>plus Strength bonus). <b><u>Those struck by the spear must save vs. paralyzation or be numbed by cold ( </u></b><b><i><u>slow </u></i></b><b><u>for 2d4 rounds) </u></b>.</p>
					<p>In addition to those available to all baatezu, the gelugon can use these spell-like powers: <i>detect invisibility </i>(always active), <i>detect magic </i>, <i>fly </i>, <i>polymorph self </i>, and <i>wall of ice </i>. They can attempt to <i>gate </i>in 2 to 12 barbazu (50% chance, once per day), 2 to 8 osyluth (35% chance, once per day), and 1 to 2 gelugons (20% chance, once per day). Because gelugons guard the front of Baator's lowest layer, there is a 25% chance that a pit fiend comes to aid them if the gelugons are losing in combat.</p>
					<p>Gelugons can see perfectly in total darkness, and regenerate 2 hit points per round. <b><u>They radiate </u></b><b><i><u>fear </u></i></b><b><u>in a 1 foot radius (save vs. rod, staff, wand or flee in panic for 1 melee rounds) </u></b>.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Second in power and station only to the pit fiends, gelugons are the guardians of Caina, the frigid eighth layer of Baator. Because Caina is a single layer away from the heart of Baator, the pit fiends have placed great trust in the gelugons.</p>
					<p>Gelugons are the only baatezu native to Caina. Although other varieties of baatezu occasionally come to this cold place, they dislike it and prefer the hotter layers. Gelugons are unique in baatezu society in that they both lead and serve in their layer's armies. It is unknown how they choose their leaders.</p>
					<p>The only portal to the fortress of Malsheem on Nessus, the lowest layer of Baator, lies at the bottom of a deep pit in Caina, guarded at all times by 9,999 gelugons.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Wholly unnatural creatures, gelugons can only be created by promotion from lower stations.</p>
					<p>When a gelugon has performed well, it may be promoted to pit fiend. Such promotion is difficult: First, the gelugon must serve flawlessly for 777 years. Any blemish on its record eliminates it from the promotion list. But 777 years of perfect service is the easy part. If the gelugon is selected to become a pit fiend, it enters the Pit of Flame, where it is tormented for 1,001 days. After almost three years of hideous, painful torture, the former gelugon emerges as a pit fiend.</p>

					<p>The most terrible baatezu, pit fiends are giant winged humanoids, gargoylish in appearance, with huge bat-wings that can wrap around their body in defense, large fangs that drip with vile, green liquid, and hulking red, scaly bodies that burst into flame when thev are angered or excited.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>: No baatezu is more terrifying in combat than a pit fiend. The pit fiend uses its 18/00 Strength (+6 damage adjustment) to attack six times per round, dividing its attacks among up to six different opponents if necessary. <b><u>It can attack with two hard, scaly wing buffets ( 1d4 points of damage </u></b><u>each), powerful claws (1d6 points), and a bite (2d6 points and poison; save vs. poison or die in 1d4 rounds) </u>. The bite also infects the victim with a disease, whether or not he saves against the poison.</p>
					<p>Pit fiends can also attack with their tail every round ( <b>2d4 points of damage </b>). The tail can then hold and constrict the victim for <b>2d4 points of damage </b>per round until the victim makes a successful Strength check to break free. Pit fiends also carry jagged-toothed clubs which inflict <b>1d6+1 points of damage </b>; this replaces one claw attack.</p>
					<p>In addition to those magical abilities inherent to all baatezu, a pit fiend can use one of the following spell-like powers once per round: <i>detect magic </i>, <i>detect invisibility </i>, <i>fireball </i>, <i>hold person </i>, <i>improved invisibility </i>, <i>polymorph self </i>, <i>produce flame </i>, <i>pyrotechnics </i>, and <i>wall of fire </i>, Once per year, a pit fiend can cast a <i>wish </i>spell. Once per round, it may automatically <i>gate </i>in two lesser baatezu or one greater baatezu. <b><u>Once per day, a pit fiend can use a </u></b><b><i><u>symbol of pain </u></i></b><b><u>; the victim must save vs. rod, staff, or wand or suffer a -4 penalty on attack rolls and a -2 penalty to Dexterity for 2d10 rounds </u></b>.</p>
					<p>Pit fiends regenerate 2 hit points per round. <b><u>They radiate a powerful </u></b><b><i><u>fear </u></i></b><b><u>aura in a 20-foot radius (save versus rod, staff, or wand at a -3 penalty or flee in panic for 1d10 rounds) </u></b>.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Pit fiends are the lords of Baator, the baatezu with the greatest power and station. Pit fiends are found throughout Baator, but are very rare on the upper layers and in the frigid cold of Caina, the eighth layer. Pit fiends are very rare on Avernus, Dis, and Minauros. They are rare on phlegethos, Stygia, Malbolge, and Maladomini. In the fearful realm of Nessus, the pit fiends are common.</p>
					<p>Wherever they are, pit fiends wield enormous power. They lead legions of dozens of complete armies into battle against the tanar'ri. These huge forces are terrifying to behold, and any non-native of the Lower Planes of less than 10 Hit Dice who sees them flees in panic for 1 to 3 days. <b><u>Those of 10 Hit Dice and greater must save vs. rod, staff, or wand or flee in panic for 1d12 turns </u></b>.</p>
					<p>It is rumored that pit fiends are not the most powerful beings in Baator, but themselves servants of some greater power. If there are greater beings in Baator, certainly they are powerful enough to hide their presence from mere mortal sages.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Pit fiends are spawned from the powerful gelugons of Baator's eighth layer. When gelugons are found worthy, they are cast into the Pit of Flame for 1,001 days. They emerge as pit fiends.</p>

					<p>The lowliest denizens of Baator, lernures are grotesque, disfigured blobs of molten flesh, with a vaguely humanoid torso and head. Their faces are equally unrecognizable, with twisted, melted features molded into permanent expressions of horrid anguish. Sometimes, lemures display some slight vestige of their mortal life: a facial feature, nervous twitch, or a small shred of clothing. However, these fragments of their former lives become less and less apparent as the lemure passes its tortured, wretched existence as the weakest baatezu in Baator. Lemures have no minds and no means of communicating.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Unless ordered otherwise, lemures relentlessly attack anything except another baatezu, regardless of danger. They never check morale.</p>
					<p>In combat, they claw for <b>1d3 points of damage </b>. Their main strength is in their large numbers. Lemures attack in wave after wave, dozens of them, until they either wear down more powerful opponents or are destroyed.</p>
					<p>Lemures have no mind of their own, so they are <b><u>immune to any mind-affecting spells such as </u></b><b><i><u>charm person </u></i></b><b><u>or illusions </u></b>. They do not, however, have the spell-like abilities common to other baatezu.</p>
					<p>Lemures regenerate 1 hit point per melee round. Any piece of a lemure, even its burnt ashes, regenerates until the creature is whole again. The only way to permanently destroy lemures is with holy water, a holy sword, or other holy item.</p>
					<p>In desperate battles when success is more important than huge losses, baatezu leaders initiate a fearsome battle drive, a wedge formation of 1,000 or more lemures. On command from a superior, the lemures march slowly, mindlessly toward their destination. As they arrive, the lemure are invariably cut down by the dozens. Oblivious, they attack with +2 to their attack rolls. Eventually, the sheer number of lemures prevails, but they commonly see 70 to 90% casualties.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Lemures are wretched creatures, forever tormented by the other baatezu. Their existence is both dismal and insignificant.</p>
					<p>They wander the first two layers of Baator in large hordes, avoiding other haatezu and relentlessly attacking intruders. Sages believe there are infinite numbers of lemures on Baator.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Occasionally a lemure is selected to form a spinagon, a least baatezu. This is done randomly, and is not based on merit, although sometimes, for the pleasure of the baatezu involved, more than one lemure is selected for such a promotion. The mindless lemures are pitted against each other in a brutal fight to the death. Winners of such a fight are either promoted to spinagons or slaughtered outright, depending on their entertainment value. Lemures are occasionally transformed into wraiths or spectres, as well. Other baatezu consider the lemures beneath notice.</p>

					<p>The barbazu are the vilest soldiers in Baator, employed in large numbers as elite shock troops. A barbazu is a foul, humanoid creature with a long tail, clawed hands and feet, pointed ears, and a snaky, disgusting beard. Its skin is moist, though scaly like a reptile. It carries a cruel, saw-toothed glaive capable of heavy damage.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>The barbazu are the most violent baatezu, taking advantage of any excuse to attack. This makes them unpopular and subject to frequent, harsh discipline, but by the same token they make excellent shock troops. Deployed in large armies sometimes numbering in the thousands, barbazu guard the middle layers of Baator and launch devastating attacks against the tanar'ri. They also make popular guards for personal treasure or demesnes of the more powerful baatezu.</p>
					<p>The barbazu attacks with a saw-toothed glaive ( <b>2d6 points of damage </b>, and wound bleeds for 2 points of damage each round until wound is bound or victim dies). Bleeding glaive wounds are cumulative (2 points of damage per round per wound). The barbazu can attack with two claws ( <b>1d2 points of damage </b>each) and its wirelike beard ( <b>1d8 points of damage </b>). If both claws hit, the beard automatically hits for maximum damage. Also, when the beard hits, there is a 25% chance the victim contracts a disease from the foul attack.</p>
					<p>A barbazu can use the following spell-like powers, in addition to those available to all baatezu: <i>affect normal fires </i>, <i>command </i>, <i>fear </i>(by touch), and <i>produce flame </i>. Once per day the barbazu can also attempt to <i>gate </i>in 2 to 12 abishai (50% chance of success) or 1 to 6 additional barbazu (35% chance).</p>
					<p>Barbazu are subject to a battle frenzy. In combat a group of barbazu is 10% likely per melee round to go berserk. The roll is cumulative per melee round, so that it they are 20% likely to go berserk on the second round, 30% on the third, and so forth. They stay berserk until combat ceases. While berserk, the barbazu need not make morale checks. They attack twice as many times per round at +2 on attack rolls and damage dice. Their Armor Class, however, takes a +3 penalty.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>The barbazu are bred for battle. All other denizens of Baator recognize their exceeding cruelty and extreme value in combat. Barbazu rush into combat and often do not stop until either they or their opponent is dead. Perhaps the most impetuous and chaotic of the baatezu, they have gained a bad reputation among outsiders.</p>
					<p>Although barbazu are lesser baatezu, they never command armies. They are simply too chaotic to lead. Sometimes an exceptional barbazu is promoted to osyluth, but most never survive to see promotion.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>The barbazu fill the armies of Baator's middle layers and commonly guard greater baatezu. They do not fight out of loyalty or comraderie, but rather out of their violent need to hurt and kill.</p>

					<p>Erinyes, most unusual of the baatezu, do not appear gruesome or disgusting but attractive, a fitting characteristic considering their mission. Erinyes are female, but can look like mortal men or women of any race, and always the most perfect physical specimens. They cannot, however, pass for mortals, for their huge, feathery wings mark them as denizens of Baator.</p>
					<p>Erinyes can communicate through telepathy, but prefer direct speech when luring mortals. They can speak any known language.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Erinyes prefer to use powers rather than fight physically, but they can wield any weapon with proficiency. An erinyes can <i>cause fear </i>in any creature that looks upon it. <b><u>The victim must save vs. rod, staff, or wand or flee in panic for 1d6 rounds </u></b>. Erinyes carry a <i>rope of entanglement </i>that they use in combat or to bind unsuspecting victims.</p>
					<p>Erinyes possess a powerful <i>charm person </i>ability that works against any target the erinyes looks on within 60 feet, even if the victim does not look back. <b><u>The victim must immediately save vs. spells as if half his current level </u></b>. For example, an 8th-level warrior would save as though he were 4th level. Failure means the victim becomes completely loyal to the erinyes and does anything to protect and obey it, even when that means the death of the victim or loved ones. Fortunately for mortal beings, an erinyes can only charm one person at a time. The effects of the charm last until the erinyes releases the victim or dies.</p>
					<p>In addition to those available to all baatezu, an erinyes can use the spell-like powers detect invisibility, invisibility, locate object, polymorph self, and produce flame. Once per day it can attempt to gate in either 1 to 8 spinagons (50% chance) or 1 to 4 barbazu (35% chance).</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Cunning and evil, the solitary erinyes have the special duty among the baatezu of tempting mortals. Even though the erinyes are lesser baatezu, they report directly to the Dark Eight outside the normal chain of command.</p>
					<p>Only 500 erinyes exist at any one time. Lesser baatezu are promoted to fill out their numbers.</p>
					<p>As tempters, the erinyes can do something no other baatezu can do, not even the pit fiends: enter the Prime Material Plane unsummoned. There it tries, through its <i>charm person </i>power and its comely form to lure mortals back to Baator. They cannot bring anyone or anything with them when they pass into the Prime Material Plane, and they can only bring one person back when they return. They cannot bring hack inorganic matter, so victims arrive in Baator without possessions.</p>
					<p>Mortals so trapped are doomed to die in the inhuman plains of Baator unless their own strength can save them. A mortal who dies this way becomes a lemure and serves forever as a soldier of Baator. Because of this power to tempt and doom mortals, most baatezu respect the erinyes.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Unlike other baatezu, the erinyes often refuse promotion from their station. Many do not wish to give up the special status afforded to them and return to the routine ranks of Baator.</p>

					<p>Hamatula are solitary patrollers of the third and fourth layers of Baator. They are large humanoids, covered from head to toe with sharp barbs right down to their long, meaty tails. Each hamatula has unusually long, sharp claws on its hands, and keen eyes that shift and dart about, giving the creature a nervous look.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Hamatula are guardians and patrol troops They are excellent guardians and are never surprised.</p>
					<p>Hamatula rarely use weapons in combat, preferring to attack with two raking claws ( <b>2d4 points of damage </b>each) and bite ( <b>3d4 points of damage </b>). If a hamatula hits in combat with both claw attacks, it can hug its victim, impaling him on its cruel barbs ( <b>2d4 points of damage </b>, no attack roll required). The victim is now pinned and takes <b>2d4 points of damage </b>per round until released. (A hamatula that takes 15 points of damage in a single round will release its victim at the end of the round.) A victim who has 16 or greater Strength can tear free with a successful Strength check.</p>
					<p>In addition to the magical abilities inherent to all baatezu, hamatula have the spell-like powers <i>affect normal fires </i>, <i>hold person </i>, <i>produce flame </i>, and <i>pyrotechnics </i>. Once per day they can also attempt to <i>gate </i>in either 2 to 12 abishai (50% chance) or 1 to 4 hamatula (35% chance)</p>
					<p>Hamatula radiate <i>fear </i>upon striking an opponent for the first time. <b><u>The defender must save vs. rod, staff or wand or flee in panic for 1d6 rounds </u></b>.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Hamatula zealously patrol the third and fourth layers of Baator for intruders, knowing that promotion and increased status hinge on success.</p>
					<p>Relatively solitary, the hamatula travel in groups only when commanded to do so by a superior. They may be deployed in a small group to investigate a report of intrusion.</p>
					<p>On Phlegethos, the fourth layer of Baator, the pit fiend Gazra lives in a crystal castle. The hamatula cast captured intruders into the cells under the castle for torture. Gazra oversees the first four layers of Baator with an army of 5,000 hamatula. Twenty hamatula with maximum hit points guard him at all times. Loyal service to their lord is the fastest way to rise in status.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Unlike other baatezu, hamatula cannot pass from layer to layer on Baator or to other Lower Planes. Sages speculate that this ensures that the creatures do not wander from their duties.</p>
					<p>Hamatula are doubly unique among the baatezu because only they produce a useful byproduct. A gland behind their ears produces a powerful hallucinogen that is <i>harvested </i>by greater baatezu and used to torment and interrogate prisoners. A few brave (or wealthy) sages have obtained samples of this secretion, though not enough to perform any meaningful experiments. They believe that greater quantities of this secretion could produce an extremely potent <i>potion of illusion </i>.</p>

					<p>The 'police officer' of Baator, the osyluth is horrid: bony and wretched, almost a dried husk of a human form, with a fearsome human skull covered by sickly dried skin stretched tight. The osyluth has a large scorpionlike tail and a foul odor of decay and rot.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Terrible opponents, osyluths attack ruthlessly, driven by hatred and rage. They have two claw attacks ( <b>1d4 points of damage </b>each) and a bite ( <b>1d8 points of damage </b>). Osyluth also attack with their tail, which does <b>3d4 points of damage </b>and injects poison. <b><u>The victim must save vs. poison with a -3 penalty </u></b>. Failure means the victim loses 1d4 points of Strength for 1d10 rounds.</p>
					<p>In addition to those available to all baatezu, osyluths have the spell-like powers <i>fly </i>, <i>improved phantasmal force </i>, <i>invisibility </i>, and <i>wall of ice </i>. Osyluths can also generate <i>fear </i>in a 5-foot radius. <b><u>Defenders must save vs. rod, staff, or wand or flee in panic for 1d6 rounds </u></b>. Once per day they may also attempt to <i>gate </i>in either 1 to 100 nupperibo (50% chance) or 1 to 2 osyluths (35% chance). Osyluths can see perfectly in total darkness.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Osyluths are the only baatezu to have power over baatezu of higher station. They roam the layers and observe the actions of other baatezu, ensuring that they act properly. An osyluth can send offenders into the Pit of Flame for 101 days of torment. After the torture, the offending baatezu returns to its former position. Osyluths have this power over any other baatezu save for pit fiends, who are above their discipline.</p>
					<p>But with this power comes danger. Any baatezu that has the opportunity to destroy an osyluth without being discovered usually does so. If caught in this act, however, the offender is instantly reduced to marked lemure status. These marked lemures never advance beyond their station and are particularly hated by all baatezu.</p>
					<p>Because the osyluths are charged with disciplining other baatezu, they are supposed to be absolutely loyal, never step out of line, nor do anything against the nature of baatezu. The osyluths generally obey the stricture, although several historical exceptions are known.</p>
					<p><i>The Ring of Cantrum: </i>Once per century, 100 osyluths meet with the Dark Eight to promote gelugons to pit fiend status. The moot is named after the pit fiend Cantrum, the founder of the Dark Eight. The 100 osyluths gather in a ring around the pit fiends and present information on promising gelugons, including major campaigns and compliance with the nature of Baator. All 100 osyluths combined have one of the nine votes cast in the Ring.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Osyluths spend a century as such before advancing among the baatezu. Following every Ring of Cantrum, all 1,000 osyluths advance to hamatula status. Simultaneously, 1,000 new osyluths are formed. Despite this guaranteed advancement, osyluths still have incentives to surpass even their exacting standards. An osyluth that performs with distinction becomes an amnizu rather than a hamatula. This accelerated advancement is rare, but serves the pit fiends well for it guards against complacency in the osyluth ranks.</p>

					<p>Baboons are large, herbivorous monkeys. They usually live in the trees of tropical and subtropical jungles, but tribes are sometimes found in tropical mountains and plains.</p>
					<p>Baboons have dark brown fur, long arms and legs, and large heads with dog-like muzzles and sharp canine teeth. Most baboon tails are short and stubby, but some are as much as two feet long. A collar of gray fur circles the necks of the largest males.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>If the tribe's home territory is entered, the baboons will try to drive the invaders off, but it is 90% likely that a baboon tribe will flee if threatened or surprised, hiding in trees or behind ground foliage until the danger has passed. Extremely agile, baboons can climb at twice their normal movement in fiveround bursts when fleeing from an enemy. However, if cornered or if an infant is endangered, baboons can be vicious fighters, particularly the larger males. Baboons attack by dropping on their victims from above or charging and leaping, biting with their sharp teeth for <b>1d4 points of damage </b>. The tribe is led by 2d4 large males that serve as the first line of defense and receive a +1 damage bonus to their attacks. Male baboons sometimes attempt to discourage intruders by baring their fangs and screeching.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Baboons live in tribes of 10-40, though some tribes include as many as 100 members. About half the tribe are juveniles or infants; the remainder are adult males and females. The young will not attack, and female generally attack only if their children are threatened. Females give birth to one child every year.</p>
					<p>Baboons eat in the morning, nap during the afternoon, then rest at night after a final meal, sleeping in tree branches or on rocky cliffs. Though the males may roam several miles searching for food, they always return to the tribe before sundown, carrying fruit, nuts, and other food in pouches in their cheeks. Baboons are among the more intelligent primates, with excellent memories and an insatiable curiosity. They do not collect treasure.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Baboons eat fruit, seeds. grass, roots, and leaves. They also enjoy bird eggs and insects. When food is scarce, baboons will eat live prey, such as mice and frogs. Groups of large males have been known to chase down and kill small antelope and leopards, though this is extremely unusual. Given the opportunity, most predators will eat baboons. Since jungle baboons spend most of their time in the high trees, they are generally safe from attacks. Giant snakes are their most feared natural enemies. Mountain baboons have a harder time of it; their enemies include mountain lions, sabre-tooths, and wolf packs.</p>
					<p>Men hunt baboons for their furry pelts and chewy but succulent meat. Baboon teeth are sometimes used for necklaces and other simple jewelry. If captured when young, baboons can be tamed as pets. Some primitive cultures consider baboons to be sacred and worship them as emissaries of the gods.</p>
					<p><b>Banderlog</b></p>
					<p>Banderlogs resemble baboons with green skin and brown fur. They are somewhat stronger than baboons and are able to communicate in a simple language of chatters and grunts. Not as panic prone as baboons, banderlogs attack at close quarters with their long canine teeth for <b>1d4+1 points of damage </b>, but are more likely to use coconuts or retch plant globes (the purple membranous fruit of retch plants, also know as globe palms) as missile weapons. Banderlogs will cling to tree branches with one hand and hurl missiles with the other at targets up to 30 feet away. Coconuts strike for <b>1d4+1 points of damage </b>and retch plant globes burst to splash nauseating fluid over a five-foot radius with a 25% chance for splash contact at a distance of 1d6+3 feet (splashed creatures vomit and retch for three rounds, and their Strengths are reduced by half for the next hour; no saving throw allowed). Like baboons, banderlogs can climb for short bursts at twice their normal movement allowance.</p>
					<p>Banderlogs are organized into small tribes led by one or more large males with 6-8 hp per die (+1 damage to attacks). They live in communal nests made of leaves in the higher branches of palm trees. They normally do not collect treasure, but there is 5% chance that a tribe has a piece of jewelry or some other random valuable item in their nest. Their diet is similar to that of baboons, occasionally supplemented by rodents and large insects. Lions and other carnivores prey on banderlogs, while hunters kill them to make furs from their pelts and jewelry from their teeth.</p>

					<p>Badgers are carnivorous burrowing animals that live underground and hunt at night. Badgers are quick-tempered and courageous; if threatened, badgers will unhesitatingly attack creatures many times larger than themselves.</p>
					<p>The badger's plump body is about two feet long, covered from head to toe with long thick fur. From a distance, the badger appears to be silver or gray in color, but a close examination reveals that each shaft of hair is actually a combination of several colors, usually gray, black, white, and brown. A white stripe about one to two inches thick begins at the badger's nose and runs between its eyes and down its back. Black patches of fur adorn each side of its lace. The badger gets its name from these <i>badges </i>of color.</p>
					<p>The badger's short legs are extremely strong, ending in sharp claws that enable it to burrow through the rockiest soil and effectively defend itself from predators. When attempting to catch scents in the air, the badger perches on its hind legs like a gopher. It waddles when it walks, making it look awkward and clumsy as its body slowly shifts from side to side. But the badger actually can move quite fast when necessary; in fact, its speed accounts for its relatively high AC rating. The badger has sharp senses of smell, hearing, and sight. It also gives off an unpleasant aroma similar to human sweat.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>If a badger is encountered away from its lair, it normally attempts to run away and hide. However, if disturbed in its lair or if cornered, it fights with surprising viciousness, regardless of the size or strength of its opponent. The badger attacks by baring its sharp teeth and lunging at its opponent, attempting to bite and claw. Snapping, chewing, and slashing, the badger goes for its opponent's throat if within reach, otherwise it assaults the opponent's abdomen; any exposed areas of an opponent, such as face or arms, are also likely targets of a badger's attack. A badger snarls and salivates while attacking, and in most cases fights to the death.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Badgers are extremely skilled burrowers. They prefer to dig their dens in the soft earth of forest floors and farmlands, but they can also thrive in mountains and hillsides. The entrance to a badger den is a circular hole about one to two feet in diameter, surrounded by a ring of soil from the original excavation. The tunnel angles gently into the earth, is usually about four to six feet long, and ends in a chamber that can be as small as four feet wide or as large as 10 feet wide, depending on the size of the family. The floor of the den is typically littered with remnants of previous meals and beds of beasts and grass for sleeping. Badgers are not particularly good housekeepers; if a den becomes excessively filthy, the family may relocate to a nearby area and dig new living quarters.</p>
					<p>Badgers are not social animals, but they are extremely loyal to their mates and their families. Badgers are most typically encountered as either solitary creatures or as a mated pair. If more than a pair is encountered, the rest are the pair's offspring. A family reacts aggressively toward any strangers, including other badgers, invading the immediate territory of its den.</p>
					<p>Male badgers hunt at night while the females remain in the den to care for their young. If a mated pair has no young, they often hunt together. Badgers bring captured prey back to their den and usually devour the entire creature, bones and all. When not hunting, badgers stay home. Badgers living in cold climates hibernate for most of the winter. Badgers do not collect treasure.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Badger flesh is greasy, tough, and not particularly appetizing. Because of their vicious nature, hunting badgers is not worth the trouble for most predators, although a hungry wolf or fox can occasionally be seen pawing the entrance to a badger den. Badgers eat rodents, squirrels, gophers, and other small animals.</p>
					<p>Badger fur is sold commercially to make coats, gloves, and mufflers. A quality pelt brings as much as 10-30 gold pieces. Badger hair can be made into brushes.</p>
					<p><b>Giant Badger</b></p>
					<p>There is a very rare variety of badger found in remote forests that grows to about twice the size of the common badger (about four feet long). It inflicts more damage when attacking, and it tends to be more aggressive. Its statistics are otherwise identical to those of the common badger. Its pelt is also more valuable.</p>

					<p>Of the various monsters that inhabit the rifts of the plane of Gehenna, the barghest is certainly the most common and one of the most fearsome. The barghest's natural shape is very much the same as that of a large goblin, and when dwelling among goblins, it generally retains that form.</p>
					<p>While it appears to be a large goblin when it is a whelp, its skin darkens from yellow to a bluish-red as it grows larger and stronger, and eventually its skin turns an even blue at adulthood. The eyes of the monster glow orange when it is excited, but otherwise they are indistinguishable from those of a normal goblin.</p>
					<p>A barghest is also able to assume at will the form of a large war dog or a wild dog. Hence, the creature has oftentimes been referred to as a 'devil-dog', but this is a misnomer. The precise form taken can vary from creature to creature, but all forms are those of typical wild or war dogs, and it is almost impossible (95% unlikely) to tell one from its natural counterpart. However, natural dogs instantly recognize, fear, and hate a barghest, and they will attack it at any opportunity.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Barghests employ a claw/claw attack in battle. (In canine form, they only bite.) They may only be hit by weapons of <b><u>+1 or better enchantment </u></b>. <b><u>They are not particularly vulnerable to any attack form, but in their canine shape they risk the failure of a saving throw vs. spell when subjected to a </u></b><b><i><u>fireball </u></i></b><b><u>, </u></b><b><i><u>flame strike </u></i></b><b><u>, or </u></b><b><i><u>meteor swarm </u></i></b><b><u>spell: If attacked by such a spell while in canine form and a barghest fails its saving throw, it is instantly hurled to Gehenna </u></b>. Those returned to the Outer Plane are most likely slain or enslaved by their full-grown fellows, but even if they are not so treated they cannot return to the Prime Material Plane without outside assistance.</p>
					<p>Barghests are able to perform the following spell-like abilities, once per round, at will: <i>shape change </i>(into either canine or goblinlike form), <i>levitate </i>, <i>misdirection </i>, and <i>project image </i>. They are able to perform the following abilities once per day: <i>charm </i>(person or monster), <i>dimension door </i>, and <i>emotion </i>.</p>
					<p>When in canine form, barghests are able to move at double their normal movement rate (maximum of 30), <i>pass without a trace </i>(as the spell), and become 75% unlikely to be noticed when motionless. If undetected, they impose a -2 penalty on opponents' surprise rolls.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>These beings are native to Gehenna and tend to live in isolation on that plane. There, each barghest has its own stronghold and force of servitors, over which it rules despotically. Goblins readily recognize and worship barghests (even in their goblinoid form), but other races find them to be virtually indistinguishable from these common prime-material monsters. The goblin hosts fear and serve the barghests, often going to great lengths to bring them suitable gifts and sacrifices, and the barghests respond by slaying powerful enemies of the goblins as well as generally enriching the goblins' treasure hoards.</p>
					<p>Occasionally, a barghest on Gehenna will spawn a litter of six young, which are immediately sent to the Prime Material Plane to feed and grow. Those that survive eventually return to Gehenna, but while they are away, they must feed upon humans and demihumans. Barghest whelps are found either alone or in pairs or the Prime Material Plane, generally living near isolatea communities of humans or with bands of goblins.</p>
					<p>When barghest whelps first come to the Prime Material, they are relatively weak, having only 6+6 Hit Dice. However, for every energy (experience) level of human (or demihuman) life that they slay or devour, 1 hit point is added to their overall total. Once they absorb eight levels, they gain another Hit Die, plus an additional hit point per die. (Hence, a 6+6 HD barghest who absorbs eight experience levels becomes a 7+7 HD barghest.) Note that 0-level characters are worth only one-half of an experience level to the barghest, so they are considerably less attractive targets than high-level heroes. In addition, each time a barghest gains a Hit Die, its Armor Class decreases by 1 and its Strength score increases from an initial 18/00 to a maximum of 24. When the barghest finally achieves full growth and power, it discovers the ability to <i>plane shift </i>to Gehenna, where it seeks its own reeking valley rift to lord over.</p>
					<p>What treasure barghests gather into their own strongholds in Gehenna is unknown, although it is rumored to be great. However, while they live upon the Prime Material Plane, they accumulate no personal treasure.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>The barghest passes through different stages in its life. As a whelp it is a hunter and tracker consigned to the Prime Material Plane. There it grows in cunning and wisdom until it is ready to enter into the next stage of its life. At this phase it returns to Gehenna and becomes a leader. It is still a hunter, though now its tactics and attitudes are greater, to match the game - other intelligent beings - that it hunts.</p>

					<p>These reptilian monsters all posses a gaze that enables them to turn any fleshy creature to stone; their gaze extends into the Astral and Ethereal planes.</p>
					<p><b>Basilisk</b></p>
					<p>Although it has eight legs, its sluggish metabolism allows only a slow movement rate. A basilisk is usually dull brown in color, with a yellowish underbelly. Its eyes glow pale green.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>While it has strong, toothy jaws, the basilisk's major weapon is its gaze. However, if its gaze is reflected, and it sees its own eyes, it will become petrified itself, but this requires light at least equal to bright torchlight and a good, smooth reflector. In the Astral plane its gaze kills; in the Ethereal plane it turns victims into ethereal stone. These will only be seen by those in the Ethereal plane or who can see ethereal objects.</p>
					<p><b>Greater Basilisk</b></p>
					<p>The greater basilisk is a larger cousin of the more common reptilian horror, the ordinary basilisk. These monsters are typically used to guard treasure.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>The monster attacks by raising its upper body, striking with sharp claws, and biting with its toothy maw. <b><u>The claws carry a Type K poison (saving throws vs. poison are made with a +4 bonus) </u></b>. <b><u>Its foul breath is also poisonous, and all creatures, coming within 5 feet of its mouth, even if just for a moment, must roll successful saving throws vs. poison (with a+2 bonus) or die (check each round of exposure) </u></b>.</p>
					<p>Even if a polished reflector is used under good lighting conditions, the chance for a greater basilisk to see its own gaze and become petrified is only 10%, unless the reflector is within 10 feet of the creature. (While its gaze weapon is effective to 50 feet, the creature's oddly-shaped eyes are nearsighted and it cannot see its own gaze unless it is within 10 feet.)</p>
					<p><b>Dracolisk</b></p>
					<p>The sages say that the dracolisk is the offspring of a rogue black dragon and a basilisk of the largest size.</p>
					<p>The result is a deep brown, dragon-like monster that moves with relative quickness on six legs. It can fly, but only for short periods - a turn or two at most.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>This horror can attack with its taloned forelegs and deliver vicious bites. In addition, it can spit a stream of acid 5 feet wide and up to 30 feet away. <b><u>The acid causes 4d6 points of damage </u></b><u>, half-damage if a successful saving throw vs. breath weapon is rolled </u>. The dracolisk can spit up to three times per day.</p>
					<p>The eyes of a dracolisk can petrify any opponent within 20 feet if the monster's gaze is met. Because its hooded eyes have nictating membranes, the monster is only 10% likely to be affected by its own gaze. Opponents in melee with a dracolisk and seeking to avoid its gaze fight with a -4 penalty to their to attack rolls.</p>

					<p>While it has strong, toothy jaws, the basilisk's major weapon is its gaze. However, if its gaze is reflected, and it sees its own eyes, it will become petrified itself, but this requires light at least equal to bright torchlight and a good, smooth reflector. In the Astral plane its gaze kills; in the Ethereal plane it turns victims into ethereal stone. These will only be seen by those in the Ethereal plane or who can see ethereal objects.</p>
					<p><b>Greater Basilisk</b></p>
					<p>The greater basilisk is a larger cousin of the more common reptilian horror, the ordinary basilisk. These monsters are typically used to guard treasure.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>The monster attacks by raising its upper body, striking with sharp claws, and biting with its toothy maw. <b><u>The claws carry a Type K poison (saving throws vs. poison are made with a +4 bonus) </u></b>. <b><u>Its foul breath is also poisonous, and all creatures, coming within 5 feet of its mouth, even if just for a moment, must roll successful saving throws vs. poison (with a+2 bonus) or die (check each round of exposure) </u></b>.</p>
					<p>Even if a polished reflector is used under good lighting conditions, the chance for a greater basilisk to see its own gaze and become petrified is only 10%, unless the reflector is within 10 feet of the creature. (While its gaze weapon is effective to 50 feet, the creature's oddly-shaped eyes are nearsighted and it cannot see its own gaze unless it is within 10 feet.)</p>
					<p><b>Dracolisk</b></p>
					<p>The sages say that the dracolisk is the offspring of a rogue black dragon and a basilisk of the largest size.</p>
					<p>The result is a deep brown, dragon-like monster that moves with relative quickness on six legs. It can fly, but only for short periods - a turn or two at most.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>This horror can attack with its taloned forelegs and deliver vicious bites. In addition, it can spit a stream of acid 5 feet wide and up to 30 feet away. <b><u>The acid causes 4d6 points of damage </u></b><u>, half-damage if a successful saving throw vs. breath weapon is rolled </u>. The dracolisk can spit up to three times per day.</p>
					<p>The eyes of a dracolisk can petrify any opponent within 20 feet if the monster's gaze is met. Because its hooded eyes have nictating membranes, the monster is only 10% likely to be affected by its own gaze. Opponents in melee with a dracolisk and seeking to avoid its gaze fight with a -4 penalty to their to attack rolls.</p>

					<p>Bats are common animals in many parts of the world. While ordinary bats are annoying but harmless, larger varieties can be quite deadly.</p>
					<p>With almost 2,000 different species of bats known, one can find wingspans from less than two inches across to 15 feet or more. The small body of the ordinary bat resembles a mouse, while the wings are formed from extra skin stretched across its fore limbs. The larger bats are scaled up but otherwise similar in appearance.</p>
					<p>Despite the common belief that bats are blind, nearly all known species have rather good eyesight. In the dark, however, they do not rely on their visual acuity, but navigate instead by echo-location. By emitting a high-pitched squeal and listening for it to bounce back to them, they can <i>see </i>their surroundings by this natural form of sonar.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Ordinary bats attack only if cornered and left with no other option. If startled, bats tend to become frightened and confused. This causes them to swarm around and often fly into things. The typical bat swarm ends up putting out torches (1% chance per bat encountered per round), confusing spell casting (Wisdom roll required to cast spells), inhibiting combatants' ability to wield weapons (by a -2 THAC0 penalty), and otherwise getting in the way. Under ideal flying conditions, a bat's Armor Class rating rises from 8 to 4.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>While bats are found almost anywhere, they prefer warm and humid climes. Some species hibernate during the cold season and a few are know to migrate. Bats live in caves, dark buildings, or damp crevices, hanging by their toes during the day, and leaving at dusk to feed during the night. In large, isolated caverns there may be thousands of bats.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Most bats eat fruit or insects, though some include small animals or fish in their diets. The rare vampire bat travels at night to drink the warm blood of living mammals, but its victims are rarely humans or demihumans. Care must be taken not to confuse the vampire bat with the true vampire in this regard. Rot grubs and carrion crawlers are among the few creatures known to live in the guano on the floor of large bat-infested caverns, making any expeditions into such caves dangerous indeed. If the noxious odor from the guano is not enough to subdue the hardiest of adventurers (a single Constitution check to stay conscious), these crawling denizens are.</p>
					<p><b>Large Bat</b></p>
					<p>These creatures are large versions of the carnivorous variety of the ordinary bat with 3-foot-long bodies and 5- to 6-foot-long wingspans. They dwell in dark caverns, usually underground, and depend on their sonar in flight to compensate for their poor eyesight. Only 10% of giant bats are of the more powerful 1 Hit Die variety.</p>
					<p>Extremely maneuverable in flight, large bats gain an Armor Class bonus of +3 when an opponent with a Dexterity of 13 or less fires a missile weapon at it. The creature must land (usually on its victim) to attack with its bite. The typical example of this species inflicts <b>1d2 points of damage </b>with its teeth while the larger does <b>1d4 points of damage </b>. Anyone bitten by a large bat has a 1% chance per point of damage done to contract rabies.</p>
					<p>When rabies is contracted, there is a 1d4+6 day incubation period. Once this period has ended, the victim has 10 days to live. The victim cannot drink or eat anything and is overly irritable. Anything from loud noises to being awakened at night can set the victim off (the DM determines the temper triggers). If temper flares, the victim must roll a Wisdom check. If the check fails, the rabid person attacks until he is killed or knocked unconscious. When a character contracts rabies, he or she dies from the infliction, unless cured by a <i>wish </i>, <i>alter reality </i>, <i>limited wish </i>, <i>cure disease </i>, or similar spell.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Huge Bat (Mobat)</b></p>
					<p>Mobats prefer warm-blooded prey that they bite to death with their fangs. They have a dim and evil intelligence that gives them a desire for shiny objects. Because the typical mobat has a wingspan of 12 to 16 feet, they must have large areas to serve as flight runways.</p>
					<p>Because Mobats' flight is so rapid and silent, their victims suffer a -3 penalty to their surprise rolls. <b><u>They can also give a piercing screech that causes such great pain that victims seek to cover their ears rather than fight, unless a saving throw versus paralyzation is successful </u></b>. This screech is always used if the prey resists and it is effective in a 20-foot radius about the mobat. Note that mobile mobats have an Armor Class of 2. Under crowded flying conditions, their Armor Class suffers and raises to 7. When not in flight, mobats have an Armor Class of 10.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Azmyth</b></p>
					<p>Azmyths live on flowers, small plants, and insects. They are solitary wanderers, though they do have <i>favorite haunts </i>to which they return. They often form partnerships with humanoids for mutual benefit, sometimes forming loyal friendships in the process. Azmyths have been known to accompany creatures for their entire lives, and then accompany the creatures' offspring. The life span of azmyths are presently unknown but is believed to be over 100 years. They are not familiars as wizards understand the term; no direct control can be exercised over one, except by spells.</p>
					<p>Azmyths have crested heads and bearded chins, white, pupil-less eyes, and leathery gray, mauve, or emerald green skin. They emit shrill squeaks of alarm or rage, and endearing, liquid chuckles of delight or amusement. They communicate by <i>telepathy </i>that has a range of 60 feet, and have infravision to 90 feet. They can <i>know alignment </i>three times per day, <i>become invisible </i>(self only for six rounds or less, ending when the azmyth makes a successful attack) once per day, and <i>create silence 15' radius </i>, centered on themselves, once per day.</p>
					<p>In combat, the azmyth bites for 1 point of damage and stabs with its powerful needle-sharp tails for 1d2 points. Twice per day, an azmyth can unleash a shocking grasp attack, transmitting 1d8+6 points of electrical damage through any direct physical contact with another creature. This attack can be combined with a physical attack for cumulative damage.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Night Hunter</b></p>
					<p>This species, know as dragazhar, is named after the adventurer who first domesticated one, long ago.</p>
					<p>Nocturnal on the surface, it is active anytime in the gloom of the underworld. It eats carrion if it must, but usually hunts small beasts. Desperate dragazhar are known to attack livestock, drow, or humans.</p>
					<p>Night hunters swoop down to bite prey (1d4), rake with their wing claws (1d2 each), and slash (1d6) or stab (3d4) with their dexterous, triangular-shaped, razor sharp tails. They stalk their prey, flying low and dodging behind hillocks, ridges, trees, or stalactites, to attack from ambush. They have infravision to a distance of 120 feet, but rarely surprise opponents, since they emit echoing, loon-like screams when excited.</p>
					<p>Night hunter lairs usually contain over 30 creatures. They typically live in double-ended caves, or above ground in tall, dense woods. Night hunters do not tarry to eat where they feel endangered, so their lairs often contain treasure fallen from prey carried there. Night hunters roost head-down when sleeping. They are velvet in hue, even to their claws, and have violet, orange, or red eyes.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Sinister</b></p>
					<p>These mysterious jet-black creatures most closely resemble manta rays. They have no distinct heads and necks, and their powerfully-muscled wings do not show the prominent finger bones common to most bats. A natural ability of <i>levitation </i>allows them to hang motionless in midair. This unnerving appearance and behavior has earned them their dark name, but sinisters are not evil. Above ground, they prefer to hunt at night, when their 160'-range infravision is most effective. They eat carrion if no other food is available, and regularly devour flowers and seed pods of all sorts.</p>
					<p>Sinisters are both <b><u>resistant to magic and adept in its use </u></b>. In addition to their pinpoint, precision <i>levitation </i>, they are surrounded at all times by a naturally-generated 5-foot-deep energy field akin to a <i>wall of force </i>. This field affords no protection against spells or melee attacks, but missile attacks are stopped utterly; normal missiles are turned away, and such effects as <i>magic missile </i>and <i>Melf's acid arrow </i>are absorbed harmlessly. In addition, all sinisters can cast one <i>hold monster </i>(as the spell) once per day. They usually save this for escaping from creatures more powerful than themselves, but may use it when hunting, if ravenous.</p>
					<p>Curiously, though they are always silent (communicating only with others of its kind via 20-foot-range limited telepathy), sinisters love music - both vocal and instrumental. Many a bard making music at a wilderness campfire has found him or herself surrounded by a silent circle of floating sinisters. Unless they are directly attacked, the sinisters will not molest the bard in any way, but may follow the source of the music, gathering night after night to form a rather daunting audience.</p>
					<p>Sinisters are usually encountered in small groups and are thought to have a long life span. Their social habits and mating rituals are unknown.</p>

					<p>Because Mobats' flight is so rapid and silent, their victims suffer a -3 penalty to their surprise rolls. <b><u>They can also give a piercing screech that causes such great pain that victims seek to cover their ears rather than fight, unless a saving throw versus paralyzation is successful </u></b>. This screech is always used if the prey resists and it is effective in a 20-foot radius about the mobat. Note that mobile mobats have an Armor Class of 2. Under crowded flying conditions, their Armor Class suffers and raises to 7. When not in flight, mobats have an Armor Class of 10.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Azmyth</b></p>
					<p>Azmyths live on flowers, small plants, and insects. They are solitary wanderers, though they do have <i>favorite haunts </i>to which they return. They often form partnerships with humanoids for mutual benefit, sometimes forming loyal friendships in the process. Azmyths have been known to accompany creatures for their entire lives, and then accompany the creatures' offspring. The life span of azmyths are presently unknown but is believed to be over 100 years. They are not familiars as wizards understand the term; no direct control can be exercised over one, except by spells.</p>
					<p>Azmyths have crested heads and bearded chins, white, pupil-less eyes, and leathery gray, mauve, or emerald green skin. They emit shrill squeaks of alarm or rage, and endearing, liquid chuckles of delight or amusement. They communicate by <i>telepathy </i>that has a range of 60 feet, and have infravision to 90 feet. They can <i>know alignment </i>three times per day, <i>become invisible </i>(self only for six rounds or less, ending when the azmyth makes a successful attack) once per day, and <i>create silence 15' radius </i>, centered on themselves, once per day.</p>
					<p>In combat, the azmyth bites for 1 point of damage and stabs with its powerful needle-sharp tails for 1d2 points. Twice per day, an azmyth can unleash a shocking grasp attack, transmitting 1d8+6 points of electrical damage through any direct physical contact with another creature. This attack can be combined with a physical attack for cumulative damage.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Night Hunter</b></p>
					<p>This species, know as dragazhar, is named after the adventurer who first domesticated one, long ago.</p>
					<p>Nocturnal on the surface, it is active anytime in the gloom of the underworld. It eats carrion if it must, but usually hunts small beasts. Desperate dragazhar are known to attack livestock, drow, or humans.</p>
					<p>Night hunters swoop down to bite prey (1d4), rake with their wing claws (1d2 each), and slash (1d6) or stab (3d4) with their dexterous, triangular-shaped, razor sharp tails. They stalk their prey, flying low and dodging behind hillocks, ridges, trees, or stalactites, to attack from ambush. They have infravision to a distance of 120 feet, but rarely surprise opponents, since they emit echoing, loon-like screams when excited.</p>
					<p>Night hunter lairs usually contain over 30 creatures. They typically live in double-ended caves, or above ground in tall, dense woods. Night hunters do not tarry to eat where they feel endangered, so their lairs often contain treasure fallen from prey carried there. Night hunters roost head-down when sleeping. They are velvet in hue, even to their claws, and have violet, orange, or red eyes.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Sinister</b></p>
					<p>These mysterious jet-black creatures most closely resemble manta rays. They have no distinct heads and necks, and their powerfully-muscled wings do not show the prominent finger bones common to most bats. A natural ability of <i>levitation </i>allows them to hang motionless in midair. This unnerving appearance and behavior has earned them their dark name, but sinisters are not evil. Above ground, they prefer to hunt at night, when their 160'-range infravision is most effective. They eat carrion if no other food is available, and regularly devour flowers and seed pods of all sorts.</p>
					<p>Sinisters are both <b><u>resistant to magic and adept in its use </u></b>. In addition to their pinpoint, precision <i>levitation </i>, they are surrounded at all times by a naturally-generated 5-foot-deep energy field akin to a <i>wall of force </i>. This field affords no protection against spells or melee attacks, but missile attacks are stopped utterly; normal missiles are turned away, and such effects as <i>magic missile </i>and <i>Melf's acid arrow </i>are absorbed harmlessly. In addition, all sinisters can cast one <i>hold monster </i>(as the spell) once per day. They usually save this for escaping from creatures more powerful than themselves, but may use it when hunting, if ravenous.</p>
					<p>Curiously, though they are always silent (communicating only with others of its kind via 20-foot-range limited telepathy), sinisters love music - both vocal and instrumental. Many a bard making music at a wilderness campfire has found him or herself surrounded by a silent circle of floating sinisters. Unless they are directly attacked, the sinisters will not molest the bard in any way, but may follow the source of the music, gathering night after night to form a rather daunting audience.</p>
					<p>Sinisters are usually encountered in small groups and are thought to have a long life span. Their social habits and mating rituals are unknown.</p>

					<p>Bats are common animals in many parts of the world. While ordinary bats are annoying but harmless, larger varieties can be quite deadly.</p>
					<p>With almost 2,000 different species of bats known, one can find wingspans from less than two inches across to 15 feet or more. The small body of the ordinary bat resembles a mouse, while the wings are formed from extra skin stretched across its fore limbs. The larger bats are scaled up but otherwise similar in appearance.</p>
					<p>Despite the common belief that bats are blind, nearly all known species have rather good eyesight. In the dark, however, they do not rely on their visual acuity, but navigate instead by echo-location. By emitting a high-pitched squeal and listening for it to bounce back to them, they can <i>see </i>their surroundings by this natural form of sonar.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Ordinary bats attack only if cornered and left with no other option. If startled, bats tend to become frightened and confused. This causes them to swarm around and often fly into things. The typical bat swarm ends up putting out torches (1% chance per bat encountered per round), confusing spell casting (Wisdom roll required to cast spells), inhibiting combatants' ability to wield weapons (by a -2 THAC0 penalty), and otherwise getting in the way. Under ideal flying conditions, a bat's Armor Class rating rises from 8 to 4.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>While bats are found almost anywhere, they prefer warm and humid climes. Some species hibernate during the cold season and a few are know to migrate. Bats live in caves, dark buildings, or damp crevices, hanging by their toes during the day, and leaving at dusk to feed during the night. In large, isolated caverns there may be thousands of bats.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Most bats eat fruit or insects, though some include small animals or fish in their diets. The rare vampire bat travels at night to drink the warm blood of living mammals, but its victims are rarely humans or demihumans. Care must be taken not to confuse the vampire bat with the true vampire in this regard. Rot grubs and carrion crawlers are among the few creatures known to live in the guano on the floor of large bat-infested caverns, making any expeditions into such caves dangerous indeed. If the noxious odor from the guano is not enough to subdue the hardiest of adventurers (a single Constitution check to stay conscious), these crawling denizens are.</p>
					<p><b>Large Bat</b></p>
					<p>These creatures are large versions of the carnivorous variety of the ordinary bat with 3-foot-long bodies and 5- to 6-foot-long wingspans. They dwell in dark caverns, usually underground, and depend on their sonar in flight to compensate for their poor eyesight. Only 10% of giant bats are of the more powerful 1 Hit Die variety.</p>
					<p>Extremely maneuverable in flight, large bats gain an Armor Class bonus of +3 when an opponent with a Dexterity of 13 or less fires a missile weapon at it. The creature must land (usually on its victim) to attack with its bite. The typical example of this species inflicts <b>1d2 points of damage </b>with its teeth while the larger does <b>1d4 points of damage </b>. Anyone bitten by a large bat has a 1% chance per point of damage done to contract rabies.</p>
					<p>When rabies is contracted, there is a 1d4+6 day incubation period. Once this period has ended, the victim has 10 days to live. The victim cannot drink or eat anything and is overly irritable. Anything from loud noises to being awakened at night can set the victim off (the DM determines the temper triggers). If temper flares, the victim must roll a Wisdom check. If the check fails, the rabid person attacks until he is killed or knocked unconscious. When a character contracts rabies, he or she dies from the infliction, unless cured by a <i>wish </i>, <i>alter reality </i>, <i>limited wish </i>, <i>cure disease </i>, or similar spell.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Huge Bat (Mobat)</b></p>
					<p>Mobats prefer warm-blooded prey that they bite to death with their fangs. They have a dim and evil intelligence that gives them a desire for shiny objects. Because the typical mobat has a wingspan of 12 to 16 feet, they must have large areas to serve as flight runways.</p>
					<p>Because Mobats' flight is so rapid and silent, their victims suffer a -3 penalty to their surprise rolls. <b><u>They can also give a piercing screech that causes such great pain that victims seek to cover their ears rather than fight, unless a saving throw versus paralyzation is successful </u></b>. This screech is always used if the prey resists and it is effective in a 20-foot radius about the mobat. Note that mobile mobats have an Armor Class of 2. Under crowded flying conditions, their Armor Class suffers and raises to 7. When not in flight, mobats have an Armor Class of 10.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Azmyth</b></p>
					<p>Azmyths live on flowers, small plants, and insects. They are solitary wanderers, though they do have <i>favorite haunts </i>to which they return. They often form partnerships with humanoids for mutual benefit, sometimes forming loyal friendships in the process. Azmyths have been known to accompany creatures for their entire lives, and then accompany the creatures' offspring. The life span of azmyths are presently unknown but is believed to be over 100 years. They are not familiars as wizards understand the term; no direct control can be exercised over one, except by spells.</p>
					<p>Azmyths have crested heads and bearded chins, white, pupil-less eyes, and leathery gray, mauve, or emerald green skin. They emit shrill squeaks of alarm or rage, and endearing, liquid chuckles of delight or amusement. They communicate by <i>telepathy </i>that has a range of 60 feet, and have infravision to 90 feet. They can <i>know alignment </i>three times per day, <i>become invisible </i>(self only for six rounds or less, ending when the azmyth makes a successful attack) once per day, and <i>create silence 15' radius </i>, centered on themselves, once per day.</p>
					<p>In combat, the azmyth bites for 1 point of damage and stabs with its powerful needle-sharp tails for 1d2 points. Twice per day, an azmyth can unleash a shocking grasp attack, transmitting 1d8+6 points of electrical damage through any direct physical contact with another creature. This attack can be combined with a physical attack for cumulative damage.</p>

They stalk their prey, flying low and dodging behind hillocks, ridges, trees, or stalactites, to attack from ambush. They have infravision to a distance of 120 feet, but rarely surprise opponents, since they emit echoing, loon-like screams when excited.</p>
					<p>Night hunter lairs usually contain over 30 creatures. They typically live in double-ended caves, or above ground in tall, dense woods. Night hunters do not tarry to eat where they feel endangered, so their lairs often contain treasure fallen from prey carried there. Night hunters roost head-down when sleeping. They are velvet in hue, even to their claws, and have violet, orange, or red eyes.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Sinister</b></p>
					<p>These mysterious jet-black creatures most closely resemble manta rays. They have no distinct heads and necks, and their powerfully-muscled wings do not show the prominent finger bones common to most bats. A natural ability of <i>levitation </i>allows them to hang motionless in midair. This unnerving appearance and behavior has earned them their dark name, but sinisters are not evil. Above ground, they prefer to hunt at night, when their 160'-range infravision is most effective. They eat carrion if no other food is available, and regularly devour flowers and seed pods of all sorts.</p>
					<p>Sinisters are both <b><u>resistant to magic and adept in its use </u></b>. In addition to their pinpoint, precision <i>levitation </i>, they are surrounded at all times by a naturally-generated 5-foot-deep energy field akin to a <i>wall of force </i>. This field affords no protection against spells or melee attacks, but missile attacks are stopped utterly; normal missiles are turned away, and such effects as <i>magic missile </i>and <i>Melf's acid arrow </i>are absorbed harmlessly. In addition, all sinisters can cast one <i>hold monster </i>(as the spell) once per day. They usually save this for escaping from creatures more powerful than themselves, but may use it when hunting, if ravenous.</p>

					<p>A rather common omnivorous mammal, bears tend to avoid humans unless provoked. Exceptions to this rule can be a most unfortunate occurrence.</p>
					<p>Bears are, in general, large and powerful animals which are found throughout the world's temperate and cooler climates. With dense fur protecting them from the elements and powerful claws protecting them from other animals, bears are the true rulers of the animal kingdom in the areas where they live.</p>
					<p>The so-called black bear actually ranges in color from black to light brown. It is smaller than the brown bear and the most widespread species by far.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Although black bears are usually not aggressive, they are able fighters when pressed. If a black bear scores a paw hit with an 18 or better it also hugs for 2-8 (2d4) points of additional damage.</p>

					<p>Giant beetles are similar to their more ordinary counterparts, but thousands of times larger - with chewing mandibles and hard wings that provide substantial armor protection.</p>
					<p>Beetles have two pairs of wings and three pairs of legs. Fortunately, the wings of a giant beetle cannot be used to fly, and in most cases, its six bristly legs do not enable it to move as fast as a fleeing man. The hard, chitinous shell of several varieties of these beetles are brightly colored, and sometimes have value to art collectors. While their shells protect beetles as well as plate mail armor, it is difficult to craft armor from them, and a skilled alchemist would need to be brought in on the job.</p>
					<p>All beetles are basically unintelligent and always hungry. They will feed on virtually any form of organic material, including other sorts of beetles. They taste matter with their antennae, or feelers; if a substance tasted is organic, the beetle grasps it with its mandibles, crushes it, and eats it. Because of the thorough grinding of the mandibles, nothing eaten by giant beetles can be revived by anything short of a <i>wish </i>. Beetles do not hear or see well, and rely primarily on taste and feel.</p>
					<p>Except as noted below, giant beetles are not really social animals; those that are found near each other are competitors for the same biological niche, not part of any family unit.</p>
					<p><b>Bombardier Beetle</b></p>
					<p>The bombardier beetle is usually found above ground in wooded areas. It primarily feeds on offal and carrion, gathering huge heaps of the stuff in which to lay its eggs.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>If it is attacked or disturbed, there is a 50% chance each round that it will turn its rear toward its attacker and fire off an 8-foot, spherical cloud of reeking, reddish, acidic vapor from its abdomen. This cloud causes <b>3d4 points of damage </b>per round to any creature within range. Furthermore, the sound caused by the release of the vapor has a 20% chance of stunning any creature with a sense of hearing within a 15-foot radius, and a like chance for deafening any creature that was not stunned. Stunning lasts for 2d4 rounds, plus an additional 2d4 rounds of deafness afterwards. Deafening lasts 2d6 rounds. The giant bombardier can fire its vapor cloud every third round, but no more than twice in eight hours.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>The bombardier action of this beetle is caused by the explosive mixture of two substances that are produced internally and combined in a third organ. If a bombardier is killed before it has the opportunity to fire off both blasts, it is possible to cut the creature open and retrieve the chemicals. These chemicals can then be combined to produce a small explosive, or fire a projectile, with the proper equipment.</p>
					<p>The chemicals are also of value to alchemists, who can use them in various preparations. They are worth 50 gp per dose.</p>
					<p><b>Boring Beetle</b></p>
					<p>Boring beetles feed on rotting wood and similar organic material, so they are usually found individually inside huge trees or massed in underground tunnel complexes.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>The large mandibles of the boring beetle have a powerful bite and will inflict up to 20 points on damage to the victim.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Individually, these creatures are not much more intelligent than other giant beetles, but it is rumored that nests of them can develop a communal intelligence with a level of consciousness and reasoning that approximates the human brain. This does not mean that each beetle has the intelligence of a human, but rather that, collectively, the entire nest has attained that level. In these cases, the beetles are likely to collect treasure and magical items from their victims.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>In tunnel complexes, boring beetles grow molds, slimes, and fungi for food, beginning their cultures on various forms of decaying vegetable and animal matter and wastes.</p>
					<p>One frequent fungi grown is the shrieker, which serves a dual role. Not only is the shrieker a tasty treat for the boring beetle, but it also functions as an alarm when visitors have entered the fungi farm. Boring beetles are quick to react to these alarms, dispatching the invaders, sometimes eating them, but in any case gaining fresh organic matter on which to raise shrieker and other saprophytic plants.</p>
					<p><b>Fire Beetle</b></p>
					<p>The smallest of the giant beetles, fire beetles are nevertheless capable of delivering serious damage with their powerful mandibles. They are found both above and below ground, and are primarily nocturnal.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Despite its name, the fire beetle has no fire attacks, relying instead on its huge mandibles to inflict up to three times the damage of a dagger in a single attack.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Fire beetles have two special glands above their eyes and one near the back of their abdomens. These glands produce a luminous red glow, and for this reason they are highly prized by miners and adventurers. This luminosity persists for ld6 days after the glands are removed from the beetle, and the light shed will illuminate a radius of 10 feet.</p>
					<p>The light from these glands is <i>cold </i>- it produces no heat. Many mages and alchemists are eager to discover the secret of this cold light, which could be not only safe, but economical, with no parts to heat up and burn out. In theory, they say, such a light source could last forever.</p>
					<p><b>Rhinoceros Beetle</b></p>
					<p>This uncommon monster inhabits tropical and subtropical jungles. They roam the rain forests searching for fruits and vegetation, and crushing anything in their path. The horn of a giant rhinoceros beetle extends about 6 feet.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>The mandibles of this giant beetle inflict <b>3d6 points of damage </b>on anyone unfortunate enough to be caught by them; the tremendous horn is capable of causing <b>2d8 points of damage </b>by itself.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>The shell of this jungle dweller is often brightly colored or iridescent. If retrieved in one piece, these shells are valuable to clerics of the Egyptian pantheon, who use them as giant scarabs to decorate temples and other areas of worship. It is a representation of this, the largest of all beetles, that serves as the holy symbol for clerics of Apshai, the Egyptian god whose sphere of influence is said to include all insects.</p>
					<p><b>Stag Beetle</b></p>
					<p>These woodland beetles are very fond of grains and similar growing crops, and they sometimes become great nuisances when they raid cultivated lands.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Like other beetles, they have poor sight and hearing, but they will fight if attacked or attack if they encounter organic material they consider food. The giant stag beetle's two horns are usually not less than 8 feet long; they inflict up to 10 points of damage each.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>The worst damage from a stag beetle raid is that done to crops; they will strip an entire farm in short order. Livestock suffers too, stampeding in fear and wreaking more havoc. The beetles may even devour livestock, if they are hungry enough.</p>
					<p><b>Water Beetle</b></p>
					<p>The giant water beetle is found only in fresh water no less than 30 feet deep.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Voracious eaters, these beetles prey upon virtually any form of animal, but will eat almost anything. Slow and ponderous on land, they move very quickly in water. Giant water beetles hunt food by scent and by feeling vibrations.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Water beetles sometimes inhabit navigable rivers and lakes, in which case they can cause considerable damage to shipping, often attacking and sinking craft to get at the tasty morsels inside.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Although they are air breathers, water beetles manage to stay underwater for extended periods of time by catching and holding a bubble of air beneath their giant wings. They will carry the bubble underwater, where it can be placed in a cave or some other cavity capable of holding an air supply.</p>

					<p>Giant beetles are similar to their more ordinary counterparts, but thousands of times larger - with chewing mandibles and hard wings that provide substantial armor protection.</p>
					<p>Beetles have two pairs of wings and three pairs of legs. Fortunately, the wings of a giant beetle cannot be used to fly, and in most cases, its six bristly legs do not enable it to move as fast as a fleeing man. The hard, chitinous shell of several varieties of these beetles are brightly colored, and sometimes have value to art collectors. While their shells protect beetles as well as plate mail armor, it is difficult to craft armor from them, and a skilled alchemist would need to be brought in on the job.</p>
					<p>All beetles are basically unintelligent and always hungry. They will feed on virtually any form of organic material, including other sorts of beetles. They taste matter with their antennae, or feelers; if a substance tasted is organic, the beetle grasps it with its mandibles, crushes it, and eats it. Because of the thorough grinding of the mandibles, nothing eaten by giant beetles can be revived by anything short of a <i>wish </i>. Beetles do not hear or see well, and rely primarily on taste and feel.</p>
					<p>Except as noted below, giant beetles are not really social animals; those that are found near each other are competitors for the same biological niche, not part of any family unit.</p>
					<p><b>Bombardier Beetle</b></p>
					<p>The bombardier beetle is usually found above ground in wooded areas. It primarily feeds on offal and carrion, gathering huge heaps of the stuff in which to lay its eggs.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>If it is attacked or disturbed, there is a 50% chance each round that it will turn its rear toward its attacker and fire off an 8-foot, spherical cloud of reeking, reddish, acidic vapor from its abdomen. This cloud causes <b>3d4 points of damage </b>per round to any creature within range. Furthermore, the sound caused by the release of the vapor has a 20% chance of stunning any creature with a sense of hearing within a 15-foot radius, and a like chance for deafening any creature that was not stunned. Stunning lasts for 2d4 rounds, plus an additional 2d4 rounds of deafness afterwards. Deafening lasts 2d6 rounds. The giant bombardier can fire its vapor cloud every third round, but no more than twice in eight hours.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>The bombardier action of this beetle is caused by the explosive mixture of two substances that are produced internally and combined in a third organ. If a bombardier is killed before it has the opportunity to fire off both blasts, it is possible to cut the creature open and retrieve the chemicals. These chemicals can then be combined to produce a small explosive, or fire a projectile, with the proper equipment.</p>
					<p>The chemicals are also of value to alchemists, who can use them in various preparations. They are worth 50 gp per dose.</p>
					<p><b>Boring Beetle</b></p>
					<p>Boring beetles feed on rotting wood and similar organic material, so they are usually found individually inside huge trees or massed in underground tunnel complexes.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>The large mandibles of the boring beetle have a powerful bite and will inflict up to 20 points on damage to the victim.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Individually, these creatures are not much more intelligent than other giant beetles, but it is rumored that nests of them can develop a communal intelligence with a level of consciousness and reasoning that approximates the human brain. This does not mean that each beetle has the intelligence of a human, but rather that, collectively, the entire nest has attained that level. In these cases, the beetles are likely to collect treasure and magical items from their victims.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>In tunnel complexes, boring beetles grow molds, slimes, and fungi for food, beginning their cultures on various forms of decaying vegetable and animal matter and wastes.</p>
					<p>One frequent fungi grown is the shrieker, which serves a dual role. Not only is the shrieker a tasty treat for the boring beetle, but it also functions as an alarm when visitors have entered the fungi farm. Boring beetles are quick to react to these alarms, dispatching the invaders, sometimes eating them, but in any case gaining fresh organic matter on which to raise shrieker and other saprophytic plants.</p>
					<p><b>Fire Beetle</b></p>
					<p>The smallest of the giant beetles, fire beetles are nevertheless capable of delivering serious damage with their powerful mandibles. They are found both above and below ground, and are primarily nocturnal.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Despite its name, the fire beetle has no fire attacks, relying instead on its huge mandibles to inflict up to three times the damage of a dagger in a single attack.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Fire beetles have two special glands above their eyes and one near the back of their abdomens. These glands produce a luminous red glow, and for this reason they are highly prized by miners and adventurers. This luminosity persists for ld6 days after the glands are removed from the beetle, and the light shed will illuminate a radius of 10 feet.</p>
					<p>The light from these glands is <i>cold </i>- it produces no heat. Many mages and alchemists are eager to discover the secret of this cold light, which could be not only safe, but economical, with no parts to heat up and burn out. In theory, they say, such a light source could last forever.</p>
					<p><b>Rhinoceros Beetle</b></p>
					<p>This uncommon monster inhabits tropical and subtropical jungles. They roam the rain forests searching for fruits and vegetation, and crushing anything in their path. The horn of a giant rhinoceros beetle extends about 6 feet.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>The mandibles of this giant beetle inflict <b>3d6 points of damage </b>on anyone unfortunate enough to be caught by them; the tremendous horn is capable of causing <b>2d8 points of damage </b>by itself.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>The shell of this jungle dweller is often brightly colored or iridescent. If retrieved in one piece, these shells are valuable to clerics of the Egyptian pantheon, who use them as giant scarabs to decorate temples and other areas of worship. It is a representation of this, the largest of all beetles, that serves as the holy symbol for clerics of Apshai, the Egyptian god whose sphere of influence is said to include all insects.</p>
					<p><b>Stag Beetle</b></p>
					<p>These woodland beetles are very fond of grains and similar growing crops, and they sometimes become great nuisances when they raid cultivated lands.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Like other beetles, they have poor sight and hearing, but they will fight if attacked or attack if they encounter organic material they consider food. The giant stag beetle's two horns are usually not less than 8 feet long; they inflict up to 10 points of damage each.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>The worst damage from a stag beetle raid is that done to crops; they will strip an entire farm in short order. Livestock suffers too, stampeding in fear and wreaking more havoc. The beetles may even devour livestock, if they are hungry enough.</p>
					<p><b>Water Beetle</b></p>
					<p>The giant water beetle is found only in fresh water no less than 30 feet deep.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Voracious eaters, these beetles prey upon virtually any form of animal, but will eat almost anything. Slow and ponderous on land, they move very quickly in water. Giant water beetles hunt food by scent and by feeling vibrations.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Water beetles sometimes inhabit navigable rivers and lakes, in which case they can cause considerable damage to shipping, often attacking and sinking craft to get at the tasty morsels inside.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Although they are air breathers, water beetles manage to stay underwater for extended periods of time by catching and holding a bubble of air beneath their giant wings. They will carry the bubble underwater, where it can be placed in a cave or some other cavity capable of holding an air supply.</p>

					<p>The behir is a snake-like reptilian monster whose dozen legs allow it to move with considerable speed and climb at fully half its normal movement rate. It can fold its limbs close to its long, narrow body and slither in snake-fashion if it desires. The head looks more crocodilian than snake-like, but has no difficulty in opening its mouth wide enough to swallow prey whole, the way a snake does.</p>
					<p>Behir have band-like scales of great hardness. Their color ranges from ultramarine to deep blue with bands of gray-brown. The belly is pale blue. The two large horns curving back over the head look dangerous enough but are actually used for preening the creature's scales and not for fighting.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>A behir will attack its prey by first biting and then looping its body around the victim and squeezing. If the latter attack succeeds, the victim is subject to six talon attacks next round.</p>
					<p>A behir can discharge a 20-foot long stroke of electrical energy once every 10 rounds. <b><u>This </u></b><b><i><u>lightning bolt </u></i></b><b><u>will cause 24 points of damage unless a saving throw vs. breath weapon is made </u></b>. In the latter case, the target takes only half damage.</p>
					<p>On a natural attack roll of 20 the behir swallows man-sized prey whole. Any creature swallowed will lose 1/6 of its starting Hit Points each round until it dies at the end of the sixth round. The behir will digest its meal in 12 turns, and at that time the victim is totally gone and cannot be raised from the dead. Note, however, that a creature swallowed can try to cut its way out of the behir's stomach. The inner armor class of the behir is 7, but each round the creature is in the behir it subtracts 1 from the damage each of its attacks does. This subtraction is cumulative, so on the second melee round there is a -2, on the third a -3, and so on.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Behir are solitary creatures, meeting others of their kind only to mate and hatch a clutch of 1-4 eggs. The female guards these eggs for eight months while the male hunts for the pair. When the young hatch, they are immediately turned out of the nest to fend for themselves, and the adults separate.</p>
					<p>Newly hatched behir are about 2 feet long. Behir grow at a rate of 8 feet per year until fully mature. Interestingly enough, newly hatched behir do not have all of their legs, having instead only six or eight. Additional pairs of legs grow slowly over time until the creature has its full complement when it reaches adulthood.</p>
					<p>Behir range over a territory of about 400 square miles, often living high up a cliff face in a cave.</p>
					<p>Behir are never friendly with dragonkind, and will never be found coexisting in the same geographical area with any type of dragon. If a dragon should enter a behir's territory, the behir will do everything it can to drive the dragon out. If the behir fails in this task, it will move off to find a new home. A behir will never knowingly enter the territory of a dragon.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Behir are useful to mages, priests, and alchemists for a number of concoctions. The horns of a behir can be used to brew the ink necessary to inscribe a <i>lightning bolt </i>scroll, and the sharp talons can likewise be used by a cleric to make the ink for a <i>neutralize poison </i>scroll. The heart of the behir is one of the more common ingredients for ink for a <i>protection from poison </i>scroll.</p>
					<p>As behir sometimes swallow prey whole, there is a 10% chance that there will be some small items of value inside the monster. More often than not (60%) these will be gems (10xQ). Otherwise, there is a 30% chance that there will be from 1-8 pieces of jewelry and a 10% chance that a single small magical object of an indegistible nature may be found. Such objects are never found in a behir's lair, because the creature expels this waste and buries it elsewhere.</p>
					<p>The scales are valued for their hardness and color, and are worth up to 500 gp to an armorer who can use them to fashion a highly ornate set of scale mail armor.</p>

					<p>I am not what you might think. Do you see me as a creature of evil nature or intent? I enjoy peace and solitude, not violence or pain. Yet still I'm regarded as though I were a monster - a fiend from the Abyss. Oh, yes, I know of the Abyss. I'm aware of the Outer Planes that stretch beyond our Inner Planes. I've never been there, but I have heard tales. And because my form looks a bit fiendish and I have large black wings - well, I know what you think when you see me. But I'm no devilish tormentor from the Lower Planes.</p>
					<p>Someone such as you might consider me an elemental creature. I suppose that I am - your kind refers to my home as the Paraelemental Plane of Smoke. Creatures that I call the N'raaigib, you call smoke paraelementals (that, in itself, says much of our difference, does it not?) Smoke is an integral part of my essence, and thus you would name me an elemental as well. That's fine. I'm not bothered by it - quite flattered, really. Smoke is one of the fundamental components of existence, and I'm glad that you're aware of that.</p>
					<p>I can even alter the composition of my body to become as the smoke of my home. This ability provides me with many advantages, and makes me a great deal different from you. But different is not always evil.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>When I must fight, I do so with claws and fangs <i>[1d3/1d3/1d4] </i>or with powerful blows from my large wings <i>[1d6/1d6] </i>- particularly if I am in my smoke form. Did I mention that I can transform my body into a smoky cloud? When I do, however, my wings remain completely solid.</p>
					<p>Turning to smoke is a useful defensive measure, certainly, but it also complements my natural weaponry. It allows me to weaken a foe in the manner I really prefer - from the inside. You see, if a creature such as yourself - and by that I mean someone who breathes air (not that I would ever think of harming you) - engages in combat with me, my favorite tactic is to transform my body into smoke and let my foe simply inhale me.</p>
					<p><b><u>Ah, what a wondrous feeling that is! Then, while the air-breather coughs and chokes on the vapors of which I'm composed </u></b><b><i><u>[saving throw versus poison to avoid] </u></i></b><b><u>, I make a portion or myself solid - a claw, perhaps - directly inside his body </u></b>. This causes him great distress. <i>[If the victim failed his saving throw, the attack automatically succeeds, inflicting </i><b><i>3d4 points of damage </i></b><i>per round. </i><b><i><u>Each round, the victim can attempt another saving throw versus poison to expel the smoky creature from his body </u></i></b><i>.]</i></p>
					<p>Best of all, while in my smoke form, I can be harmed only by enchanted weapons <i>[ </i><b><i><u>+1 or better] , and my resistance to magic doubles </u></i></b><i>. I can transform into smoke at will, and I can even turn only part of my body to smoke and leave the rest solid, if I wish. However, as I think I mentioned before, I can never turn fully to smoke - my wings remain solid in any situation. [If any portion of the balker is smoke, its special defenses are in effect - that is, it's hit only by </i><b><i><u>+1 or better weapons and its magic resistance doubles </u></i></b><i>.] Sadly, I can sustain my smoky form for only a short while each day [20 rounds per day, which need not be consecutive].</i></p>
					<p>Still find me fiendish or frightening? I'll tell you what - as a show of good faith, I'll even reveal to you a few of my weaknesses. Perhaps that will set your mind at ease. You see, while my smoke form helps to protect me from attacks with weapons, it makes me especially vulnerable to certain kinds of magic. Cold-based attacks inflict twice their usual damage, a <i>gust of wind </i>spell sends me up to a mile away, and a <i>wind wall </i>entraps me as if it were a <i>hold </i>spell.</p>
					<p>No matter what form I'm in, though. I'm always <b><u>immune to heat, fire, poison, paralyzation, and petrification </u></b>. And, as a last note, I apparently have the unique ability to damage other creatures that can also transform into smoke or mist - even when they're normally considered untouchable. It must be a product of the environment in which I flourish. I've never thought much about it, but I've heard that I could attack and destroy even a vampire (whatever that is) in its mist form.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Most of the time, I keep to myself. Only when one of the baser needs comes upon me do I seek out the company of others - and even then, it's only for a short time. Sometimes, though, it is enjoyable to hunt with my fellows. We work well together, bringing down our prey quickly and efficiently. If our hunger is great, we finish the meal off quickly. Other times. not so quickly. You'd be surprised how loud some creatures can squeal when they're in pain. When I catch something particularly soft-fleshed, I like to - well, I suppose you'd call that evil. You're quick to judge, aren't you?</p>
					<p>Occasionally, when things grow particularly boring, some of us find the time to procreate. Once born, however, my kind learns to survive on its own. We're not coddled like mewling infants, and that's part of what makes us strong. We thrive and nourish here in our own realm. thank you, with little interference from outsiders like yourself.</p>
					<p>Look around you, at this large cinder in which I've made my lair - impressive, yes? For the most part, cinders like these are the only solid surfaces on the entire plane, and they're quite rare. I'll slay any fool that - I mean, rather, that intruders are not welcome, even others of my kind.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>I eat whatever I please. Nothing can escape me when I'm on the hunt. Most of the time, I feed on tiny creatures that I believe you call vapor rats and smoke mephits. (Strangely enough, some of your <i>scholars </i>believe me related to the mephits - the fools.) But whenever something new crosses my path, I just can't resist - that is, I try to. ah. (smack) you, erm. Pardon me. It's just that (smack smack). it's just that you look so - well, <i>tasty </i>.</p>

					<p>Boars, a type of wild swine, are the ancestors of our domesticated hogs. Boars are, of course, more agressive than the barnyard animal, and an unexpected encounter with a family of these creatures or one large individual can be fatal.</p>
					<p>Boars look much like hogs, but have slightly shorter snouts, coarser and darker hair, and straighter tails. Some varieties have small tusks at each side of the face.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Boars are dangerous foes when angered. They have a vicious bite and those with tusks can employ them to rip at unprotected flesh with great effectiveness.</p>
					<p>The boar will fight for 2-5 (1d4+1) melee rounds after reaching 0 to -6 hit points but dies immediately at -7 or fewer hit points.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Boars live in family units as a rule. If more than one wild boar is encountered the others will be sows (3 hit dice, 2-8 (2d4) hit points damage/attack) or sounders, with a 1:4 (sows:sounders) ratio. Thus if 12 are encountered there will be 1 boar, 3 sows, and 8 young.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Boars are true omnivores who will eat virtually anything. While eating a variety of foods is generally considered healthy, in the case of the wild boar this can lead to problems. A small roundworm, Trichinella spiralis, is a parasite that can inhabit a boar's body. This creates a problem when a human eats the boar without cooking it properly, as trichinosis, the disease caused by this parasite, is easily transmissible to humans. Once infected with the parasite, the host suffers fever, sweating, and sore muscles until a <i>cure disease </i>spell is cast.</p>
					<p>Whether domesticated or not, the boar provides a number of products useful to man. All three varieties listed here are edible. Boar lard can be used interchangeably with domesticated swine lard. Leather from the wild specimen can be used for gloves and comfortable leather armor. The stiff bristles can be used for brushes.</p>
					<p><b>Giant Boar</b></p>
					<p>This prehistoric forerunner of the wild boar is also very aggressive. If 3 or more are encountered there is only a 25% chance that there will be young (2-6 hit dice, 1-4/2-5 (1d4+1)/2-7 (1d6+1)/2-8 (2d4)/3-12 (3d4) points of damage/attack) numbering from 1-4 of the total herd. The boars and sows fight equally, and either will fight for 1-4 melee rounds after reaching 0 to -10 hit points but die immediately upon reaching -11 or fewer hit points.</p>
					<p><b>Warthog</b></p>
					<p>These tropical beasts are aggressive only if their territory is threatened or if cornered. They make two slashing attacks with their large tusks. Male and female fight equally. If more than 2 are encountered the balance will be young (1-2 hit dice, 1-3/2-5 (1d4+1) points of damage/attack). The warthog will continue to fight for 1-2 melee rounds after reaching 0 to -5 hit points but at -6 or fewer points it dies immediately.</p>

					<p>Boars look much like hogs, but have slightly shorter snouts, coarser and darker hair, and straighter tails. Some varieties have small tusks at each side of the face.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Boars are dangerous foes when angered. They have a vicious bite and those with tusks can employ them to rip at unprotected flesh with great effectiveness.</p>
					<p>The boar will fight for 2-5 (1d4+1) melee rounds after reaching 0 to -6 hit points but dies immediately at -7 or fewer hit points.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Boars live in family units as a rule. If more than one wild boar is encountered the others will be sows (3 hit dice, 2-8 (2d4) hit points damage/attack) or sounders, with a 1:4 (sows:sounders) ratio. Thus if 12 are encountered there will be 1 boar, 3 sows, and 8 young.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Boars are true omnivores who will eat virtually anything. While eating a variety of foods is generally considered healthy, in the case of the wild boar this can lead to problems. A small roundworm, Trichinella spiralis, is a parasite that can inhabit a boar's body. This creates a problem when a human eats the boar without cooking it properly, as trichinosis, the disease caused by this parasite, is easily transmissible to humans. Once infected with the parasite, the host suffers fever, sweating, and sore muscles until a <i>cure disease </i>spell is cast.</p>
					<p>Whether domesticated or not, the boar provides a number of products useful to man. All three varieties listed here are edible. Boar lard can be used interchangeably with domesticated swine lard. Leather from the wild specimen can be used for gloves and comfortable leather armor. The stiff bristles can be used for brushes.</p>
					<p><b>Giant Boar</b></p>
					<p>This prehistoric forerunner of the wild boar is also very aggressive. If 3 or more are encountered there is only a 25% chance that there will be young (2-6 hit dice, 1-4/2-5 (1d4+1)/2-7 (1d6+1)/2-8 (2d4)/3-12 (3d4) points of damage/attack) numbering from 1-4 of the total herd. The boars and sows fight equally, and either will fight for 1-4 melee rounds after reaching 0 to -10 hit points but die immediately upon reaching -11 or fewer hit points.</p>
					<p><b>Warthog</b></p>
					<p>These tropical beasts are aggressive only if their territory is threatened or if cornered. They make two slashing attacks with their large tusks. Male and female fight equally. If more than 2 are encountered the balance will be young (1-2 hit dice, 1-3/2-5 (1d4+1) points of damage/attack). The warthog will continue to fight for 1-2 melee rounds after reaching 0 to -5 hit points but at -6 or fewer points it dies immediately.</p>

					<p>The grim bodaks are formed from hapless mortals who ventured into parts of the Abyss too deadly for them.</p>
					<p>A Sigil legend called 'The Bodak Who Walked Home' is probably apocryphal, but it expresses the eternal hope of triumph against vastly more powerful forces.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>Once an evil king named Basiliedus ruled his small city-state through dark magic. He captured a fair woman named Helen and sought to make her his queen. Helen's lawful husband, Diomed the swordsman, went to the palace of the dark lord and demanded his wife. Basiliedus, who could have killed the swordsman with a mere word or gesture, asked what he would do to win back his bride. 'Anything,' answered Diomed.</p>
					<p>So Basiliedus suggested that Diomed visit the Abyss and bring back a handful of soil.</p>
					<p>Diomed agreed, and Basiliedus transported him there, feeling glee at the swordsman's awful fate.</p>
					<p>Years passed, and Helen sickened and died, escaping at last the loveless union forced on her. One day a cowled man, evidently a rich merchant, came to Basiliedus' castle. He claimed to have a present for the hated lord. The cowled one was shown into Basiliedus' audience chamber.</p>
					<p>'I have brought you this,' said the visitor. He poured soil from a black silk bag onto the floor. The soil became blood, and the blood became snakes. Basiliedus knew this was soil from the Abyss, but before he could act, the visitor removed his cowl. The sight of the bodak killed all within, and Diomed, the bodak, walked outside the castle to tell the people their dread lord was dead. The sun scorched his impure flesh, but just before the rotting mass fell, Diomed is said to have smiled.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>Bodaks are humanoids with gray, pearly skin and hairless; muscular bodies of no apparent gender. Their eyes are empty and milky-white, deeply set into their long, distorted features.</p>
					<p>Bodaks are only vaguely humanoid in appearance, but sometimes retain some small feature of the mortal they once were. This may manifest itself in a nervous twitch, a peculiar combat style, or anything else that the bodak may have possessed during its normal lifetime.</p>
					<p>Bodaks have no language of their own. They speak the language common to the tanar'ri and their dark servants, and generally they remember a few words of the common speech.</p>
					<p><b><u></u></b></p>
					<p></p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p><b><u>Any person or creature that meets a bodak's death gaze must save vs. petrification or die </u></b>. The gaze is effective to 30 feet. A victim who dies in the Abyss transforms into a bodak in one day.</p>
					<p>Only cold iron weapons or <b><u>+1 or better magical weapons can hit a bodak </u></b>. They are <b><u>immune to </u></b><b><i><u>charm </u></i></b><b><u>, </u></b><b><i><u>hold </u></i></b><b><u>, </u></b><b><i><u>sleep </u></i></b><b><u>, and </u></b><b><i><u>slow </u></i></b><b><u>spells and to poison </u></b>. Bodaks possess infravision to 180 feet.</p>
					<p>Unaccustomed to its brightness, bodaks hate the sun. Direct sunlight inflicts 1 point of damage per round. Different attacks harm them as follows:</p>
					<table>
						<tr>
							<td>Attack</td>
							<td>Damage</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>Acid</td>
							<td>Full</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>Cold</td>

							<td>Silver weapon</td>
							<td>None</td>
						</tr>
					</table>
					<p>Bodaks have a faint attachment to their former lives as mortals. Rarely, this preoccupation causes the bodak to pause in combat while it considers its actions. There is a base 5% chance, rolled once per encounter, that the creature sees something in an enemy that reminds it of its mortal life. The bodak pauses and make no attacks for one melee round. After that, the bodak takes a -2 penalty to all attacks against that one character.</p>
					<p>Bodaks can attack once per round with hand weapons such as swords and maces, but they rarely carry weapons or bother with them in combat.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Bodaks wander the Abyss in abhorrent hatred of their own inhuman endurance. They hate and attack anything they see, even creatures of obviously greater power.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Many mortals have traveled to the Abyss to fight the foul creatures that inhabit it. However, some places in the Abyss are so loathsome and secretive that mortals are simply not allowed to enter. A mortal foolish enough to visit these and die is painfully transformed into a bodak.</p>
					<p><b>Benign Bodak</b></p>
					<p>For reasons unknown, occasionally a good-aligned mortal's mind survives the transition from man to bodak. This 'benign bodak' has all the powers and abilities of a bodak, but the mind of the mortal it once was. Such creatures usually die quickly in the Abyss. Note that even though a benign bodak retains its memory and consciousness, it cannot cast spells, even if it could as a mortal.</p>

					<p>Bugbears are giant, hairy cousins of goblins who frequent the same areas as their smaller relatives.</p>
					<p>Bugbears are large and very muscular, standing 7' tall. Their hides range from light yellow to yellow brown and their thick coarse hair varies in color from brown to brick red. Though vaguely humanoid in appearance, bugbears seem to contain the blood of some large carnivore. Their eyes recall those of some savage bestial animal, being greenish white with red pupils, while their ears are wedge shaped, rising from the top of their heads. A bugbear's mouth is full of long sharp fangs.</p>
					<p>Bugbears have a nose much like that of a bear with the same fine sense of smell. It is this feature which earned them their name, despite the fact that they are not actually related to bears in any way. Their tough leathery hide and long sharp nails also look something like those of a bear, but are far more dexterous.</p>
					<p>The typical bugbear's sight and hearing are exceptional, and they can move with amazing agility when the need arises. Bugbear eyesight extends somewhat into the infrared, giving them infravision out to 60 feet.</p>
					<p>The bugbear language is a foul sounding mixture of gestures, grunts, and snarls which leads many to underestimate the intelligence of these creatures. In addition, most bugbears can speak the language of goblins and hobgoblins.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Whenever possible, bugbears prefer to ambush their foes. They impose a -3 on others' surprise rolls.</p>
					<p>If a party looks dangerous, bugbear scouts will not hesitate to fetch reinforcements. A bugbear attack will be tactically sound, if not brilliant. They will hurl small weapons, such as maces, hammers, and spears before closing with their foes. If they think they are outnumbered or overmatched, bugbears will retreat, preferring to live to fight another day.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Bugbears prefer to live in caves and in underground locations. A lair may consist of one large cavern or a group of caverns. They are well-adapted to this life, since they operate equally well in daylight and darkness.</p>
					<p>If a lair is uncovered and 12 or more bugbears are encountered they will have a leader. These individuals have between 22 and 25 hit points, an Armor Class of 4, and attack as 4 Hit Die monsters. Their great strength gives them a +3 to all damage inflicted in melee combat.</p>
					<p>If 24 or more bugbears are encountered, they will have a chief in addition to their leaders. Chiefs have between 28 and 30 hit points, an Armor Class of 3, and attack as 4 Hit Die monsters. Chiefs are so strong that they gain a +4 bonus to all damage caused in melee. Each chief will also have a sub-chief who is identical to the leaders described above.</p>
					<p>In a lair, half of the bugbears will be females and young who will not fight except in a life or death situation. If they are forced into combat, the females attack as hobgoblins and the young as kobolds.</p>
					<p>The species survives primarily by hunting. They have no compunctions about eating anything they can kill, including humans, goblins, and any monsters smaller than themselves. They are also fond of wine and strong ale, often drinking to excess.</p>
					<p>Bugbears are territorial, and the size of the domains vary with the size of the group and its location. It may be several square miles in the wilderness, or a narrow, more restricted area in an underground region.</p>
					<p>Intruders are considered a valuable source of food and treasure, and bugbears rarely negotiate. On occasion, they will parley if they think they can gain something exceptional by it. Bugbears sometimes take prisoners to use as slaves.</p>
					<p>Extremely greedy, bugbears love glittery, shiny objects and weapons. They are always on the lookout to increase their hoards of coins, gems, and weapons through plunder and ambush.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Bugbears have two main goals in life: survival and treasure. They are superb carnivores, winnowing out the weak and careless adventurer, monster and animal. Goblins are always on their toes when bugbears are present, for the weak or stupid quickly end up in the stewpot.</p>

					<p>Aptly called a landshark, the bulette (pronounced Boo-lay) is a terrifying predator that lives only to eat. The bulette is universally shunned, even by other monsters.</p>
					<p>It is rumored that the bulette is a cross between an armadillo and a snapping turtle, but this is only conjecture. The bulette's head and hind portions are blue-brown, and they are covered with plates and scales ranging from gray-blue to blue-green. Nails and teeth are dull ivory. The area around the eyes is brown-black, the eyes are yellowish and the pupils are blue green.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>A bulette will attack anything it regards as edible. The only things that it refuses to eat are elves, and it dislikes dwarves. The bulette is always hungry, and is constantly roaming its territory in search of food. When burrowing underground, the landshark relies on vibrations to detect prey. When it senses something edible (i.e., senses movement), the bulette breaks to the surface crest first and begin its attack. The landshark has a temperament akin to the wolverine - stupid, mean, and fearless. The size, strength, and numbers of its opponents mean nothing. The bulette always attacks, choosing as its target the easiest or closest prey. When attacking, the bulette employs its large jaw and front feet.</p>
					<p>The landshark can jump up to 8 feet with blinding speed, and does this to escape if cornered or injured. While in the air, the bulette strikes with all four feet, causing <b>3d6 points of damage </b>for each of the rear feat as well. The landshark has two vulnerable areas: the shell under its crest is only AC 6 (but it is only raised during intense combat), and the region of the bulette's eyes is AC 4, but this is a small oval area about 8 inches across.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Fortunately for the rest of the world, the bulette is a solitary animal, although mated pairs (very rare) will share the same territory. In addition, other predators rarely share a territory with a landshark for fear of being eaten. The bulette has no lair, preferring to wander over its territory, above and below ground, burrowing down beneath the soil to rest. Since their appetites are so voracious, each landshark has a large territory that can range up to 30 square miles.</p>
					<p>Bulettes consume their victims, clothing, weapons, and all, and the powerful acids in the stomach quickly digest the armor, weapons, and magical items of their victims. They are not above nibbling on chests or sacks of coins either, the bulette motto being eat first and think later. When everything in the territory is eaten, the bulette will move on in search of a new territory. The sole criteria for a suitable territory is the availability of food, so a bulette will occasionally stake out a new territory near human and halfling territories and terrorize the residents.</p>
					<p>Very little is known of the life cycle of the bulette. They presumably hatch from eggs, but no young have ever been found, though small landsharks of 6 Hit Dice have been killed. It may be that the bulette is hatched from very small eggs, with few young surviving to maturity. Still other sages theorize that the bulette bears live young. There is also evidence that the bulette, like carp and sharks, grow larger as they get older, for unusually large landsharks of 11 feet tall and taller have been seen. Certainly no one has ever come upon the carcass of a bulette that died of old age.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>The bulette has a devastating effect on the ecosystem of any area it inhabits. Literally nothing that moves is safe from it - man, animal, or monster. In the process of hunting and roaming, the landshark will uproot trees of considerable size. In hilly and rocky regions, the underground movements of the bulette can start small landslides. Ogres, trolls, and even some giants all move off in search of greener and safer pastures when a bulette appears. A bulette can turn a peaceful farming community into a wasteland in a few short weeks, for no sane human or demihuman will remain in a region where a bulette has been sighted.</p>
					<p>There is only one known benefit to the existence of the bulette: The large plates behind its head make superb shields, and dwarven smiths can fashion them into shields of +1 to +3 in value. Some also claim that the soil through which a bulette has passed becomes imbued with magical, rock-dissolving properties. Many would argue, however, that these benefits are scarcely worth the price.</p>

					<p>Camels are the ships of the desert, and they carry a lifeline of trade and commerce in the caravans crossing the sands from city to city. Camels can withstand the rigors of desert terrain well but require careful, experienced handling. A camel's humps allow it to go without food or water for up to two weeks.</p>
					<p>Camels are tall, spindly mounts, with padded feet and awkward saddles perched before their humps. Their fur varies from white to pale tan to deep brown and from short, desert hair to shaggy mountain camel fur. The rarer white camels bring 2-5 times the usual price, as they are considered lucky. Desert, racing, and war camels are all of the one-hump variety; mountain camels have two humps.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Nasty-tempered camels have a 50% chance of spitting at persons attempting to ride them or use them as pack animals. The victim of a spit attack has a 25% chance of being blinded for 1-3 rounds.</p>
					<p>If frightened, there is a 25% chance that a herd of camels will stampede. If a herd stampedes, roll 2d4 for each creature in the path of the stampede who does not take cover (such as by hiding in a tree or behind a rock pile or wall). This is the number of camels trampling the exposed creature. Trampling causes <b>1-4 points of damage </b>per camel. Trampled opponents cannot regain their feet until the stampede passes.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Breeding camels of all types are especially valued. Camels bear only a single offspring each year, and strong and well-tempered animals are pampered to produce as many as possible before their breeding days are done.</p>
					<p>Like horses, camels can have grades of quality as described in the <i>DMG </i>, page 36.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Camels eat grass, grains, and shrubbery. They can carry heavy loads for long periods of time. The following chart shows the camels' carrying capacity in gold pieces under various loads. Camels are loaded while kneeling, and they often refuse to get up under more than their encumbered load.</p>

					<p><b>War Camel</b></p>
					<p>Suitable for most types of warfare, these animals are trained not to shy away from blood and mayhem. They attack with their bite (1d4) and with their hooves, which cause <b>1-6 points of damage </b>each. If successful, the hoof attacks force the opponent to remain prone. War camels are usually culled from the strongest members of a group of desert camels and then trained intensively for several years. In some cases, however, they are bred exclusively from retired war camels, thus improving the line.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Desert Camel</b></p>
					<p>With their wide, padded feet and fat-rich, watery humps, desert camels are ideal mounts for traveling through the wastes. They are slow but steady animals, capable of taking heavy loads through difficult climates and terrain. They sway more and have a longer, more rolling gait than horses.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Mountain Camel</b></p>
					<p>Mountain camels are common in the hills and mountains where they serve as pack animals. They are not useful in the desert.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Racing Camel</b></p>
					<p>Bred for speed rather than temperament, racing camels are the most expensive and least likable camels. They are aggressive and spit often, even at their trainers and riders. Their small hooves and long, thin legs give them incredible speed, but they are usually trained to accept only a very limited set of riders. A good racing camel costs at least twice as much as a war camel, and may cost much more.</p>

					<p>The great cats are among the most efficient of all predators.</p>
					<p><b>Cheetah</b></p>
					<p>The cheetah is a medium-sized, lightly built cat. Its fur is sand colored and it is covered with dark spots. The cheetah is unique among cats because of its non-retractable claws.</p>
					<p>A skilled hunter endowed with natural camouflage, victims of a cheetah attack suffer a -3 on their surprise roll. They are famed for their tremendous bursts of speed, and can run at triple speed (45 feet per round) for three rounds. The cat must rest 3 turns before sprinting again. Cheetahs can spring 10 feet upward or 20 feet forward. If both forepaws hit during an attack the cheetah is able to rake for <b>1-2 points of damage </b>with each of its rear claws. If defending their young, cheetahs receive a +2 on their attack and damage rolls and will fight to the death.</p>
					<p>Cheetahs inhabit warm plains and grasslands, often sharing their range with lions. Their favorite prey are the antelope that inhabit the plains, and they rarely attack men. Cheetahs are territorial, but may live alone, in pairs and in groups. The female raises a litter of 2-4 young alone. The young, who stay with their mother for as long as 2 years, can be completely trained and domesticated.</p>
					<p>The fortunes of the cheetah rise and fall with those of its prey; when the population of antelope and other game declines, so does that of the cheetah.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Jaguar</b></p>
					<p>The jaguar is a powerful cat with a deep chest and muscular limbs. Its color ranges from light yellow to brownish red, and it is covered with dark spots.</p>
					<p>The jaguar will attack anything that it perceives as a threat. It relies on stealth to close with its prey, often pouncing from above. The jaguar can leap 30' to attack. If both of its forepaws strike it will rake with its two rear claws for 2-5 (1d4+1) points of damage each.</p>
					<p>The jaguar inhabits jungles, spending a great deal of time in tree tops. It climbs, swims, and stalks superbly. Jaguars are solitary and territorial, meeting only to mate. If found in a lair, there is a 75% chance there will be 1-3 cubs. Cubs do not fight effectively.</p>
					<p>Their strength and ferocity make jaguars one of the most feared predators of the jungle.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Leopard</b></p>
					<p>The leopard is a graceful cat with a long body and relatively short legs. Its color varies from buff to tawny, and its spots are rosette shaped.</p>
					<p>Leopards prefer to leap on their prey, imposing a -3 on the surprise rolls of their victims. Leopards can spring upward 20 feet or ahead 25 feet. If they strike successfully with both forepaws, they rake with their rear claws for 1-4 points each.</p>
					<p>Leopards are solitary, inhabiting warm deserts, forest, plains, and mountains. They hunt both day and night preying on animals up to the size of large antelopes. They swim and climb well, and will often sit in treetops sunning themselves. Leopards will also drag their prey to safety in the treetops to devour in peace. The female bears 1-3 young, and cares for them for up to two years. If found in the lair, there is a 25% chance that there will be cubs there. The young have no effective attack.</p>
					<p>A skilled predator, the leopard is often threatened by human incursions. In areas where it is hunted, it is nocturnal.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Lion</b></p>
					<p>Among the largest and most powerful of the great cats, lions have yellow or golden brown fur. The males are distinguished by their flowing manes.</p>
					<p>Both male and female lions are fierce fighters. Lions hunt in prides, with females doing most of the actual hunting. Since their senses are so keen, lions can only be surprised on a 1. All lions can leap as far as 30 feet. Males have an Armor Class of 5 in their forequarters and 6 in their hindquarters while females are Armor Class 6 in all areas. If a lion hits with both forepaws, it can rake with its rear claws doing <b>2-7 points damage </b>each.</p>
					<p>Lions prefer warmer climates, thriving in deserts, jungles, grasslands, and swamps. They live and hunt in prides, and are extremely territorial. A pride usually consists of 1-3 males and 1-10 females. Lions frequently kill animals the size of zebras or giraffes. Lionesses will cooperate when hunting, driving their prey into an ambush. They have been known to attack domestic livestock, but will almost never attack men. A lair will contain from 1-10 cubs which are 30%-60% grown. Cubs are unable to fight. Lions are poor climbers and dislike swimming.</p>
					<p>Lions flourish only when the supply of game is adequate. Their size and strength have made them a favorite target of human hunters.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Mountain Lion</b></p>
					<p>Not a true lion, this brownish cat is lankier than its large cousins. Except for their size, males and females are difficult to tell apart.</p>
					<p>The mountain lion is more cautious and less aggressive than its larger relatives. They can spring upward 15 feet or ahead 20 feet to attack or retreat. If they score hits with both of their forepaws, they will rake with their back ones for <b>1-4 points of damage </b>each. It will not attack men unless threatened.</p>
					<p>Mountain lions range in warm and temperate mountains, forests, swamps, and plains. They are solitary, with males and females each maintaining separate territories. Their favorite prey are deer. The female rears 2-4 cubs alone, which remain with her for 1-2 years.</p>
					<p>The mountain lion is flexible and elusive. It is adept at surviving on the fringes of human civilization.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Spotted Lion</b></p>
					<p>Spotted lions are large, fierce, dappled versions of the lion. They are generally found in the plains of the Pleistocene epoch, and rarely occur elsewhere.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Giant Lynx</b></p>
					<p>The giant lynx is distinguished by its tufted ears and cheeks, short bobbed tail, and dappled coloring. It has a compact muscular body, with heavy legs and unusually large paws.</p>
					<p>The giant lynx is the most intelligent of the great cats and uses its wits in combat. When hiding, a giant lynx will avoid detection 90% of the time. The lynx can leap up to 15 feet and imposes a -6 on the surprise rolls of its prey. It has a 75% chance of detecting traps. If a giant lynx strikes with both forepaws, it attempts a rear claw rake, causing <b>1-3 points of damage </b>per claw. The giant lynx almost never attacks men.</p>
					<p>The giant lynx prefers cold coniferous and scrub forests. They can communicate in their own language with others of its kind, which greatly increases its chances of survival. The nocturnal lynx stalks or ambushes its prey, catching rodents, young deer, grouse, and other small game. The cubs remain with their mother for 6 months.</p>
					<p>The giant lynx has all the advantages of the great cats plus the added bonus of a high intelligence which makes it even more adaptable.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Tiger</b></p>
					<p>The tiger is the largest and most feared of the great cats. Tigers have reddish-orange fur and dark vertical stripes.</p>
					<p>A tiger is a redoubtable foe in battle and is surprised only on a 1. They are experts in stalking and often hunt in pairs or groups. They can leap 10 feet upward, and spring forward 30 feet to 50 feet to attack. If they strike successfully with both forepaws, their rear claws rake for 2-8 (2d4) points of damage per claw.</p>
					<p>This species ranges from the subarctic to the tropics, generally inhabiting wooded or covered terrain. Tigers are nocturnal, solitary, graceful climbers and swimmers who are capable of sustained high speed. These animals rarely fight among themselves, but will protect their territories ferociously. They are also the most unpredictable and dangerous of the great cats, not hesitating to attack men. Their favorite prey includes cattle, wild pigs and deer. Females raise their 1-3 cubs alone. The cubs remain with their mother for several years. If encountered in the lair, there is a 25% chance that the cubs will be present.</p>
					<p>Feared by men, tigers are hunted aggressively, and are threatened by the destruction of forests. In the untamed wilderness, however, the tiger occupies the top predatory niche.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Smilodon</b></p>
					<p>Although not truly a member of the cat family, the so-called sabre-toothed tiger is similar to them in many ways. Smilodons are known for their 6 inches long fangs which are capable of inflicting terrible wounds. Their powerful jaws and large teeth give them a +2 on their attack rolls. They are similar to normal tigers but are found only during the Pleistocene epoch.</p>

					<p>The great cats are among the most efficient of all predators.</p>
					<p><b>Cheetah</b></p>
					<p>The cheetah is a medium-sized, lightly built cat. Its fur is sand colored and it is covered with dark spots. The cheetah is unique among cats because of its non-retractable claws.</p>
					<p>A skilled hunter endowed with natural camouflage, victims of a cheetah attack suffer a -3 on their surprise roll. They are famed for their tremendous bursts of speed, and can run at triple speed (45 feet per round) for three rounds. The cat must rest 3 turns before sprinting again. Cheetahs can spring 10 feet upward or 20 feet forward. If both forepaws hit during an attack the cheetah is able to rake for <b>1-2 points of damage </b>with each of its rear claws. If defending their young, cheetahs receive a +2 on their attack and damage rolls and will fight to the death.</p>
					<p>Cheetahs inhabit warm plains and grasslands, often sharing their range with lions. Their favorite prey are the antelope that inhabit the plains, and they rarely attack men. Cheetahs are territorial, but may live alone, in pairs and in groups. The female raises a litter of 2-4 young alone. The young, who stay with their mother for as long as 2 years, can be completely trained and domesticated.</p>
					<p>The fortunes of the cheetah rise and fall with those of its prey; when the population of antelope and other game declines, so does that of the cheetah.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Jaguar</b></p>
					<p>The jaguar is a powerful cat with a deep chest and muscular limbs. Its color ranges from light yellow to brownish red, and it is covered with dark spots.</p>
					<p>The jaguar will attack anything that it perceives as a threat. It relies on stealth to close with its prey, often pouncing from above. The jaguar can leap 30' to attack. If both of its forepaws strike it will rake with its two rear claws for 2-5 (1d4+1) points of damage each.</p>
					<p>The jaguar inhabits jungles, spending a great deal of time in tree tops. It climbs, swims, and stalks superbly. Jaguars are solitary and territorial, meeting only to mate. If found in a lair, there is a 75% chance there will be 1-3 cubs. Cubs do not fight effectively.</p>
					<p>Their strength and ferocity make jaguars one of the most feared predators of the jungle.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Leopard</b></p>
					<p>The leopard is a graceful cat with a long body and relatively short legs. Its color varies from buff to tawny, and its spots are rosette shaped.</p>

					<p>The great cats are among the most efficient of all predators.</p>
					<p><b>Cheetah</b></p>
					<p>The cheetah is a medium-sized, lightly built cat. Its fur is sand colored and it is covered with dark spots. The cheetah is unique among cats because of its non-retractable claws.</p>
					<p>A skilled hunter endowed with natural camouflage, victims of a cheetah attack suffer a -3 on their surprise roll. They are famed for their tremendous bursts of speed, and can run at triple speed (45 feet per round) for three rounds. The cat must rest 3 turns before sprinting again. Cheetahs can spring 10 feet upward or 20 feet forward. If both forepaws hit during an attack the cheetah is able to rake for <b>1-2 points of damage </b>with each of its rear claws. If defending their young, cheetahs receive a +2 on their attack and damage rolls and will fight to the death.</p>
					<p>Cheetahs inhabit warm plains and grasslands, often sharing their range with lions. Their favorite prey are the antelope that inhabit the plains, and they rarely attack men. Cheetahs are territorial, but may live alone, in pairs and in groups. The female raises a litter of 2-4 young alone. The young, who stay with their mother for as long as 2 years, can be completely trained and domesticated.</p>
					<p>The fortunes of the cheetah rise and fall with those of its prey; when the population of antelope and other game declines, so does that of the cheetah.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Jaguar</b></p>
					<p>The jaguar is a powerful cat with a deep chest and muscular limbs. Its color ranges from light yellow to brownish red, and it is covered with dark spots.</p>
					<p>The jaguar will attack anything that it perceives as a threat. It relies on stealth to close with its prey, often pouncing from above. The jaguar can leap 30' to attack. If both of its forepaws strike it will rake with its two rear claws for 2-5 (1d4+1) points of damage each.</p>
					<p>The jaguar inhabits jungles, spending a great deal of time in tree tops. It climbs, swims, and stalks superbly. Jaguars are solitary and territorial, meeting only to mate. If found in a lair, there is a 75% chance there will be 1-3 cubs. Cubs do not fight effectively.</p>
					<p>Their strength and ferocity make jaguars one of the most feared predators of the jungle.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Leopard</b></p>
					<p>The leopard is a graceful cat with a long body and relatively short legs. Its color varies from buff to tawny, and its spots are rosette shaped.</p>
					<p>Leopards prefer to leap on their prey, imposing a -3 on the surprise rolls of their victims. Leopards can spring upward 20 feet or ahead 25 feet. If they strike successfully with both forepaws, they rake with their rear claws for 1-4 points each.</p>
					<p>Leopards are solitary, inhabiting warm deserts, forest, plains, and mountains. They hunt both day and night preying on animals up to the size of large antelopes. They swim and climb well, and will often sit in treetops sunning themselves. Leopards will also drag their prey to safety in the treetops to devour in peace. The female bears 1-3 young, and cares for them for up to two years. If found in the lair, there is a 25% chance that there will be cubs there. The young have no effective attack.</p>
					<p>A skilled predator, the leopard is often threatened by human incursions. In areas where it is hunted, it is nocturnal.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Lion</b></p>
					<p>Among the largest and most powerful of the great cats, lions have yellow or golden brown fur. The males are distinguished by their flowing manes.</p>
					<p>Both male and female lions are fierce fighters. Lions hunt in prides, with females doing most of the actual hunting. Since their senses are so keen, lions can only be surprised on a 1. All lions can leap as far as 30 feet. Males have an Armor Class of 5 in their forequarters and 6 in their hindquarters while females are Armor Class 6 in all areas. If a lion hits with both forepaws, it can rake with its rear claws doing <b>2-7 points damage </b>each.</p>
					<p>Lions prefer warmer climates, thriving in deserts, jungles, grasslands, and swamps. They live and hunt in prides, and are extremely territorial. A pride usually consists of 1-3 males and 1-10 females. Lions frequently kill animals the size of zebras or giraffes. Lionesses will cooperate when hunting, driving their prey into an ambush. They have been known to attack domestic livestock, but will almost never attack men. A lair will contain from 1-10 cubs which are 30%-60% grown. Cubs are unable to fight. Lions are poor climbers and dislike swimming.</p>
					<p>Lions flourish only when the supply of game is adequate. Their size and strength have made them a favorite target of human hunters.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Mountain Lion</b></p>
					<p>Not a true lion, this brownish cat is lankier than its large cousins. Except for their size, males and females are difficult to tell apart.</p>
					<p>The mountain lion is more cautious and less aggressive than its larger relatives. They can spring upward 15 feet or ahead 20 feet to attack or retreat. If they score hits with both of their forepaws, they will rake with their back ones for <b>1-4 points of damage </b>each. It will not attack men unless threatened.</p>
					<p>Mountain lions range in warm and temperate mountains, forests, swamps, and plains. They are solitary, with males and females each maintaining separate territories. Their favorite prey are deer. The female rears 2-4 cubs alone, which remain with her for 1-2 years.</p>
					<p>The mountain lion is flexible and elusive. It is adept at surviving on the fringes of human civilization.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Spotted Lion</b></p>
					<p>Spotted lions are large, fierce, dappled versions of the lion. They are generally found in the plains of the Pleistocene epoch, and rarely occur elsewhere.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Giant Lynx</b></p>
					<p>The giant lynx is distinguished by its tufted ears and cheeks, short bobbed tail, and dappled coloring. It has a compact muscular body, with heavy legs and unusually large paws.</p>
					<p>The giant lynx is the most intelligent of the great cats and uses its wits in combat. When hiding, a giant lynx will avoid detection 90% of the time. The lynx can leap up to 15 feet and imposes a -6 on the surprise rolls of its prey. It has a 75% chance of detecting traps. If a giant lynx strikes with both forepaws, it attempts a rear claw rake, causing <b>1-3 points of damage </b>per claw. The giant lynx almost never attacks men.</p>
					<p>The giant lynx prefers cold coniferous and scrub forests. They can communicate in their own language with others of its kind, which greatly increases its chances of survival. The nocturnal lynx stalks or ambushes its prey, catching rodents, young deer, grouse, and other small game. The cubs remain with their mother for 6 months.</p>
					<p>The giant lynx has all the advantages of the great cats plus the added bonus of a high intelligence which makes it even more adaptable.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Tiger</b></p>
					<p>The tiger is the largest and most feared of the great cats. Tigers have reddish-orange fur and dark vertical stripes.</p>
					<p>A tiger is a redoubtable foe in battle and is surprised only on a 1. They are experts in stalking and often hunt in pairs or groups. They can leap 10 feet upward, and spring forward 30 feet to 50 feet to attack. If they strike successfully with both forepaws, their rear claws rake for 2-8 (2d4) points of damage per claw.</p>
					<p>This species ranges from the subarctic to the tropics, generally inhabiting wooded or covered terrain. Tigers are nocturnal, solitary, graceful climbers and swimmers who are capable of sustained high speed. These animals rarely fight among themselves, but will protect their territories ferociously. They are also the most unpredictable and dangerous of the great cats, not hesitating to attack men. Their favorite prey includes cattle, wild pigs and deer. Females raise their 1-3 cubs alone. The cubs remain with their mother for several years. If encountered in the lair, there is a 25% chance that the cubs will be present.</p>
					<p>Feared by men, tigers are hunted aggressively, and are threatened by the destruction of forests. In the untamed wilderness, however, the tiger occupies the top predatory niche.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Smilodon</b></p>
					<p>Although not truly a member of the cat family, the so-called sabre-toothed tiger is similar to them in many ways. Smilodons are known for their 6 inches long fangs which are capable of inflicting terrible wounds. Their powerful jaws and large teeth give them a +2 on their attack rolls. They are similar to normal tigers but are found only during the Pleistocene epoch.</p>

					<p>The great cats are among the most efficient of all predators.</p>
					<p><b>Cheetah</b></p>
					<p>The cheetah is a medium-sized, lightly built cat. Its fur is sand colored and it is covered with dark spots. The cheetah is unique among cats because of its non-retractable claws.</p>
					<p>A skilled hunter endowed with natural camouflage, victims of a cheetah attack suffer a -3 on their surprise roll. They are famed for their tremendous bursts of speed, and can run at triple speed (45 feet per round) for three rounds. The cat must rest 3 turns before sprinting again. Cheetahs can spring 10 feet upward or 20 feet forward. If both forepaws hit during an attack the cheetah is able to rake for <b>1-2 points of damage </b>with each of its rear claws. If defending their young, cheetahs receive a +2 on their attack and damage rolls and will fight to the death.</p>
					<p>Cheetahs inhabit warm plains and grasslands, often sharing their range with lions. Their favorite prey are the antelope that inhabit the plains, and they rarely attack men. Cheetahs are territorial, but may live alone, in pairs and in groups. The female raises a litter of 2-4 young alone. The young, who stay with their mother for as long as 2 years, can be completely trained and domesticated.</p>
					<p>The fortunes of the cheetah rise and fall with those of its prey; when the population of antelope and other game declines, so does that of the cheetah.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Jaguar</b></p>
					<p>The jaguar is a powerful cat with a deep chest and muscular limbs. Its color ranges from light yellow to brownish red, and it is covered with dark spots.</p>
					<p>The jaguar will attack anything that it perceives as a threat. It relies on stealth to close with its prey, often pouncing from above. The jaguar can leap 30' to attack. If both of its forepaws strike it will rake with its two rear claws for 2-5 (1d4+1) points of damage each.</p>
					<p>The jaguar inhabits jungles, spending a great deal of time in tree tops. It climbs, swims, and stalks superbly. Jaguars are solitary and territorial, meeting only to mate. If found in a lair, there is a 75% chance there will be 1-3 cubs. Cubs do not fight effectively.</p>
					<p>Their strength and ferocity make jaguars one of the most feared predators of the jungle.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Leopard</b></p>
					<p>The leopard is a graceful cat with a long body and relatively short legs. Its color varies from buff to tawny, and its spots are rosette shaped.</p>
					<p>Leopards prefer to leap on their prey, imposing a -3 on the surprise rolls of their victims. Leopards can spring upward 20 feet or ahead 25 feet. If they strike successfully with both forepaws, they rake with their rear claws for 1-4 points each.</p>
					<p>Leopards are solitary, inhabiting warm deserts, forest, plains, and mountains. They hunt both day and night preying on animals up to the size of large antelopes. They swim and climb well, and will often sit in treetops sunning themselves. Leopards will also drag their prey to safety in the treetops to devour in peace. The female bears 1-3 young, and cares for them for up to two years. If found in the lair, there is a 25% chance that there will be cubs there. The young have no effective attack.</p>
					<p>A skilled predator, the leopard is often threatened by human incursions. In areas where it is hunted, it is nocturnal.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Lion</b></p>
					<p>Among the largest and most powerful of the great cats, lions have yellow or golden brown fur. The males are distinguished by their flowing manes.</p>
					<p>Both male and female lions are fierce fighters. Lions hunt in prides, with females doing most of the actual hunting. Since their senses are so keen, lions can only be surprised on a 1. All lions can leap as far as 30 feet. Males have an Armor Class of 5 in their forequarters and 6 in their hindquarters while females are Armor Class 6 in all areas. If a lion hits with both forepaws, it can rake with its rear claws doing <b>2-7 points damage </b>each.</p>
					<p>Lions prefer warmer climates, thriving in deserts, jungles, grasslands, and swamps. They live and hunt in prides, and are extremely territorial. A pride usually consists of 1-3 males and 1-10 females. Lions frequently kill animals the size of zebras or giraffes. Lionesses will cooperate when hunting, driving their prey into an ambush. They have been known to attack domestic livestock, but will almost never attack men. A lair will contain from 1-10 cubs which are 30%-60% grown. Cubs are unable to fight. Lions are poor climbers and dislike swimming.</p>
					<p>Lions flourish only when the supply of game is adequate. Their size and strength have made them a favorite target of human hunters.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Mountain Lion</b></p>
					<p>Not a true lion, this brownish cat is lankier than its large cousins. Except for their size, males and females are difficult to tell apart.</p>
					<p>The mountain lion is more cautious and less aggressive than its larger relatives. They can spring upward 15 feet or ahead 20 feet to attack or retreat. If they score hits with both of their forepaws, they will rake with their back ones for <b>1-4 points of damage </b>each. It will not attack men unless threatened.</p>
					<p>Mountain lions range in warm and temperate mountains, forests, swamps, and plains. They are solitary, with males and females each maintaining separate territories. Their favorite prey are deer. The female rears 2-4 cubs alone, which remain with her for 1-2 years.</p>
					<p>The mountain lion is flexible and elusive. It is adept at surviving on the fringes of human civilization.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Spotted Lion</b></p>
					<p>Spotted lions are large, fierce, dappled versions of the lion. They are generally found in the plains of the Pleistocene epoch, and rarely occur elsewhere.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Giant Lynx</b></p>
					<p>The giant lynx is distinguished by its tufted ears and cheeks, short bobbed tail, and dappled coloring. It has a compact muscular body, with heavy legs and unusually large paws.</p>
					<p>The giant lynx is the most intelligent of the great cats and uses its wits in combat. When hiding, a giant lynx will avoid detection 90% of the time. The lynx can leap up to 15 feet and imposes a -6 on the surprise rolls of its prey. It has a 75% chance of detecting traps. If a giant lynx strikes with both forepaws, it attempts a rear claw rake, causing <b>1-3 points of damage </b>per claw. The giant lynx almost never attacks men.</p>
					<p>The giant lynx prefers cold coniferous and scrub forests. They can communicate in their own language with others of its kind, which greatly increases its chances of survival. The nocturnal lynx stalks or ambushes its prey, catching rodents, young deer, grouse, and other small game. The cubs remain with their mother for 6 months.</p>
					<p>The giant lynx has all the advantages of the great cats plus the added bonus of a high intelligence which makes it even more adaptable.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Tiger</b></p>
					<p>The tiger is the largest and most feared of the great cats. Tigers have reddish-orange fur and dark vertical stripes.</p>
					<p>A tiger is a redoubtable foe in battle and is surprised only on a 1. They are experts in stalking and often hunt in pairs or groups. They can leap 10 feet upward, and spring forward 30 feet to 50 feet to attack. If they strike successfully with both forepaws, their rear claws rake for 2-8 (2d4) points of damage per claw.</p>
					<p>This species ranges from the subarctic to the tropics, generally inhabiting wooded or covered terrain. Tigers are nocturnal, solitary, graceful climbers and swimmers who are capable of sustained high speed. These animals rarely fight among themselves, but will protect their territories ferociously. They are also the most unpredictable and dangerous of the great cats, not hesitating to attack men. Their favorite prey includes cattle, wild pigs and deer. Females raise their 1-3 cubs alone. The cubs remain with their mother for several years. If encountered in the lair, there is a 25% chance that the cubs will be present.</p>
					<p>Feared by men, tigers are hunted aggressively, and are threatened by the destruction of forests. In the untamed wilderness, however, the tiger occupies the top predatory niche.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Smilodon</b></p>
					<p>Although not truly a member of the cat family, the so-called sabre-toothed tiger is similar to them in many ways. Smilodons are known for their 6 inches long fangs which are capable of inflicting terrible wounds. Their powerful jaws and large teeth give them a +2 on their attack rolls. They are similar to normal tigers but are found only during the Pleistocene epoch.</p>

					<p>Cats of different sizes and colorations are common throughout the world. Some are pets, while many are wild.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Cats are efficient hunters, moving with grace and stealth; opponents suffer a -3 penalty on surprise rolls. A cat's excellent senses and agility allows it to be surprised only on a 1 or 2. Its senses also allow it to hunt efficiently at night.</p>
					<p>Cats attack with their claws and teeth; if they hit with front claws, they rake with rear claws. A domestic cat's claws and rake each count as only one attack, rather than one per claw.</p>
					<p>Cats have retractable claws which can be extended for climbing or drawn in for speed. They are agile climbers and can scale or move in trees at half normal movement rate. They can leap great distances to avoid obstacles or spring onto prey.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Cats are common in settled regions. Many cultures keep them as pets, and they can be found in the homes of nobles and peasants alike. Some societies worship cats as divine beings, while other nations fear and hate them as the minions of evil.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Cats are commonly used to control rodent populations, though some hunters use them to recover downed birds and other small prey.</p>
					<p><b>Domestic Cat</b></p>
					<p>There are many breeds of domestic cat, all of which share basic characteristics, differing only in outward appearance. An average adult cat weighs eight to ten pounds, though some pampered specimens can weigh as much as 25 pounds.</p>
					<p>Cats seldom attack creatures larger than themselves, though they will defend themselves. They often chase and kill mice, birds, rats, and other small creatures. A domestic cat is capable of a burst of speed, boosting its movement rate to 18 for a round and maintaining such speed for 1d10 rounds.</p>
					<p>A well-treated cat will live for 15 years or more. The cat's gestation period is about two months, with 1d4+1 kittens in each litter. Kittens are weaned when about eight weeks old. Mother cats will fight to the death to defend kittens.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Wild Cat</b></p>
					<p>Wild cats are very similar to domestic cats, and some were pets that went feral. Generally, wild cats are tougher, stronger, and more capable hunters than domestic cats.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Elven Cat</b></p>
					<p>Cats kept by elves have evolved into magical creatures, possibly aided by arcane means. They are very intelligent and have their own language, and many can speak a crude form of the elven tongue. Some live with gnomes, brownies, or woodland creatures, and also speak a basic form of their keepers' language. Most have gray-brown fur with dark stripes.</p>
					<p>Elven cats are very stealthy, imposing a -5 penalty to opponents' surprise rolls. They are surprised only on a 1. Elven cats have a 99.9% chance to move silently, and a 90% chance to hide in wilderness areas. They are excellent climbers, can leap 20 feet with ease, and enjoy swimming and playing in water.</p>
					<p>Elven cats have magical abilities that they use to avoid enemies. They have limited <i>ESP </i>which is used to determine intent. They can use <i>enlarge </i>and <i>trip </i>once per day, and <i>reduce </i>and <i>tree </i>twice per day; for magical abilities, elven cats are treated as 9th-level spellcasters. <i>Enlarge </i>doubles an elven cat's Hit Dice and damage; <i>tree </i>allows it to assume the form of a tree's limb.</p>

					<p>The great snow tiger is a carnivorous beast, native to cold temperate mountains and subarctic brush. Snow tigers are vividly portrayed in legends, where they are credited with all manner of cunning, intelligence, and ferocity. Though dangerous predators and a fierce challenge to hunt, snow tigers are simply another large predator fighting for survival in cold, harsh climates.</p>
					<p>Snow tigers change color with the season as do other subarctic and arctic species. During spring and summer they are pale brown, striped with green. In fall the snow tiger's coat slowly fades to white and black stripes.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Regardless of season, the tiger blends in quite effectively with its surroundings and is treated as a hidden object, gaining automatic surprise when attacking from hiding, unless other factors intervene. Their keen senses, honed by their harsh environment, prevent them from being surprised.</p>
					<p>When attacking, snow tigers are capable of blinding bursts of speed, moving at double rate for 1d4 rounds without a penalty to attack or damage rolls.</p>
					<p>The snow tiger attacks with a savage bite and raking claws. Like other great cats, the snow tiger has large and powerful rear claws. If both front claw attacks hit in a single round, the tiger automatically rakes with both rear claws, which rip opponents for <b>2d4 points of damage </b>each.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Normally solitary, snow tigers may be encountered in mated pairs during spring and summer. During this period there is a 25% chance that a pair will have 1-2 cubs (no combat abilities). Rashemaar hunters sometimes take cubs and raise them as pets, training them to hunt. In order to be successfully trained, the cub must be less than three months old and the trainer must make three successive animal training proficiency checks. Only one check may be made per week, and if one fails the trainer must start all over again. Once a cub is over three months old, it cannot he trained and is usually returned to the wild.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>A cunning and resourceful predator, snow tigers prefer larger prey such as deer, mountain goats, sheep, and horses. During the depths of winter, snow tigers are sometimes reduced to stalking mice, rabbits, foxes, and other small game.</p>
					<p>A few are intelligent enough to realize that humans are relatively easy prey, but this is rare. Most snow tigers avoid humans, and attack only if cornered or starving.</p>
					<p>Snow tigers ars found throughout northern and eastern Faerun, though they are most common in Rashemen. There, berserkers revere its speed, strength, and hunting skill, and often try to simulate its appeareance and behaviour - there is a Rashemaar Snow Tiger berserker lodge.</p>
					<p>The Rashemaar admiration for the snow tiger does not preclude hunting the beast; in fact, it is considered a singular honor to have taken one single-handedly. Hunting snow tigers alone, unarmored, and armed only with a broad sword or a bow is a popular sport among Rashemaar nobles. Tales of intelligent tigers luring prey to its doom are but tales.</p>
					<p>Cloaks of snow tiger fur are symbols of status among the Rashemaar and some barbarian tribes. They are never sold and may be worn only by the individual who successfully slew that tiger. Individuals who wear cloaks they are not entitled to wear are usually attacked by Rashemaar who learn their secret.</p>

					<p>Centaurs are woodland beings who shun the company of men. They dwell in remote, secluded glades and pastures.</p>
					<p>The appearance of a centaur is unmistakable: they have the upper torso, arms, and head of a human being and the lower body of a large, powerful horse.</p>
					<p>Centaurs speak their own language and some among them (about 10%) can converse in the tongue of elves.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>A band of centaurs is always armed, and the leaders carry shields. Half of the centaurs will be wielding oaken clubs (the equivalent of morning stars), one quarter will carry composite bows and have 10-30 arrows (either flight or sheaf, depending on the current state of affairs in the area). The remainder of the band will be leaders (AC4; HD5) using medium shields and medium horse lances. Centaurs make 3 attacks each round in melee: once with their weapons and twice with their hooves.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Centaurs are sociable creatures, taking great pleasure in the society of others of their kind. Their overall organization is tribal, with a tribe divided into family groups living together in harmony. The size of the tribe varies, it range from 3-4 families to upwards of 20 families. Since males have the dangerous roles of hunter and protector, females outnumber males by two to one. The centaur mates for life, and the entire tribe participates in the education of the young.</p>
					<p>The lair is located deep within a forest, and consists of a large, hidden glade and pasture with a good supply of running water. Depending upon the climate, the lair may contain huts or lean-tos to shelter the individual families. Centaurs are skilled in horticulture, and have been known to cultivate useful plants in the vicinity of their lair. In dangerous, monster infested areas, centaurs will sometimes plant a thick barrier of tough thorn bushes around their lair and even set traps and snares. In the open area, away from the trees, are hearths for cooking and warmth. If encountered in their lair, there will be 1-6 additional males, females equal to twice the number of males, and 5-30 young. The females (3 Hit Dice) and the young (1-3 Hit Dice) will fight only with their hooves, and only in a life or death situation.</p>
					<p>Each tribe will have a priest who is treated as a leader but has the spell abilities of a 3rd level druid. Centaurs survive through a mixture of hunting, foraging, fishing, agriculture and trade. Though they shun dealings with humans, centaurs have been known to trade with elves, especially for food and wine. The elves are paid from the group treasury, which comes from the booty of slain monsters.</p>
					<p>The territory of a centaur tribe varies with its size and the nature of the area it inhabits. Centaurs are also not above sharing a territory with elves. The attitude of a centaur toward a stranger in its territory will vary with the visitor. Humans and dwarves will usually be asked to leave in a polite manner, while halflings or gnomes will be tolerated, and elves will be welcomed. Monsters will be dealt with in a manner according to the threat they represent to the welfare and survival of the tribe. Were a giant or dragon to enter the territory, the centaurs would pull up stakes and relocate, while trolls and orcs and their like will be killed.</p>
					<p>Centaurs will take the treasure of their fallen foes, and are fully aware of its value. Most male centaurs have a small coin supply, while the tribe has a treasury which may well include some magical items.</p>
					<p>Leaders will have twice the normal individual treasure. This treasure is used to buy food for the group, or to ransom (90% likely) captured or threatened members of the tribe.</p>
					<p>While basically neutral or chaotic good, centaurs have been known to become rowdy, boorish, and aggressive when under the influence of alcohol. They are also extremely protective of their females and young. Centaurs are basically pastoral, but will react with violence if their lifestyle and survival is threatened.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>The centaur lives in close harmony with nature and spends its lifetime carefully conserving the natural resources around its lair. The race seems to have an innate knowledge of how to achieve this precious balance. If forced to chop down a tree, a centaur will plant another to replace it. Centaurs never over hunt or over fish an area as a human group might do, but choose their game with care, limiting the amount they eat.</p>

					<p>Giant centipedes are loathsome, crawling arthropods that arouse almost universal disgust from all intelligent creatures (even other monsters). They are endemic to most regions.</p>
					<p>One of the things that makes the centipede so repulsive is its resemblance to the worm. Its long body is divided into many segments from which protrude many tiny feet. Hence the name 'centipede' (or hundred-footed). The giant centipede is so named because it is over 1-foot long. The body is plated with a chitinous shell and it moves with a slight undulating motion. The creature has the added benefit of protective coloration, and varies in color depending on the terrain it inhabits. Those that favor rocky areas are gray, those that live underground are black, while centipedes of the forest are brown or red.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>When hunting, centipedes use their natural coloration to remain unseen until they can drop on their prey from above or crawl out of hiding in pursuit of food. They attack by biting their foes and injecting a paralytic poison. The poison can paralyze a victim for 2d6 hours, but is so weak that victims are permitted a +4 bonus to their saving throw.</p>
					<p>Due to its small size, the giant centipede is less likely to resist attacks and receives a -1 penalty to all its saving throws.</p>
					<p>Although a single giant centipede rarely constitutes a serious threat to a man, these creatures frequently travel in groups. When more than one centipede is encountered, the monsters will fight independently, even to the point of fighting among themselves over fallen victims.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>The centipede behaves like most other insects, roving from place to place in search of food; it has no set territory or dwelling. The centipede simply goes where its hunger leads it. It is an aggressive and hungry carnivore that must eat at least once a day to survive. Hungry centipedes often resort to cannibalism.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Giant centipedes have several natural advantages, including poison and protective coloration, allowing them to compete with other small predators for game. Their poison bestows a certain immunity from being hunted, but hungry and skilled animals such as coyotes and large predatory birds hunt them effectively in lean times.</p>
					<p>Their preferred targets are small mammals that are easily overcome by their weak poison. If they are very hungry, however, they have been known to attack anything that moves, including humans.</p>
					<p><b>Huge Centipede</b></p>
					<p>These are identical to giant centipedes save that they are only 6 inches long. Their poison is weaker than that of their larger cousins and a failed saving throw will immobilize the victim for only 1d6 hours. Huge centipedes make their own saving throws at -2. Mice and other large insects are the favorite prey of huge centipedes. They in turn are hunted by giant centipedes.</p>
					<p><b>Megalo-centipede</b></p>
					<p>The megalo-centipede, because of its great size, is no longer classed as an irritant but is a threat to human and animal alike. Its acidic poison is far more potent than that of its weaker cousins. The victims of a megalo-centipede bite receive no bonuses on their saving throws and failure indicates death. If the target successfully resists the poison, the acid burns the victim's skin, inflicting <b>2d4 points of damage </b>.</p>
					<p>The megalo-centipede is more intelligent than its smaller cousins and it is a far more cunning hunter, although they still do not cooperate with each other. In the wilderness the megalo-centipede prey on animals the size of deer. In the subterranean environment, it attacks man-sized or smaller creatures, including orcs, goblins, or humans. The megalo-centipede receives no penalties to its own saving throws.</p>
					<p><b>Tunnel Worm</b></p>
					<p>This cousin of the giant centipede feeds upon and lays its eggs in carrion. A tunnel worm attacks by lunging out of its hidden burrow to strike with a +2 bonus to the attack roll. Success indicates the tunnel worm has seized its prey in its mandibles, but no damage is inflicted until the worm chews through the victim's armor. It takes one round for the worm to chew through leather or worse, two rounds for armor tougher than leather but no tougher than chain mail, and three rounds for armor tougher than chain mail. Once the armor is breached, the worm automatically inflicts <b>2d8 points of damage </b>each round. If the worm suffers 15 or more points of fire damage or loses 60% of its hit points, it drops its victim and retreats to its lair. Tunnel worm lairs often have treasure from earlier victims.</p>

					<p>How chimerae were created is a dark mystery better left unexplored. The chimera has the hindquarters of a large, black goat and the forequarters of a huge, tawny lion. Its body has brownish-black wings like those of a dragon.</p>
					<p>The monster has three heads, those of a goat, a lion, and a fierce dragon. The goat head is pitch black, with glowing amber eyes and long ochre horns. The lion head is framed by a brown mane and has green eyes. The dragon head is covered with orange scales and has black eyes.</p>
					<p>The chimera speaks a limited form of the foul language of red dragons. As a rule, however, it will only pause to communicate with those creatures who are more powerful than itself.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Its many heads and powerful physique make the chimera a deadly foe in combat. The monster prefers to surprise its victims, often swooping down upon them from the sky. It can attack 6 times each round, clawing with its forelegs, goring with its two horns, and biting with its lion and dragon heads. If it desires to do so, the dragon head can loose a stream of flame some 5 yards long in lieu of biting. <b><u>The dragon's fire causes 3-24 (3d8) points damage, although a saving throw vs. breath weapon will cut the damage in half </u></b>. The chimera will always attempt to breathe if its opponents are in range. If more than 1 chimera is encountered, they will attack in concert.</p>
					<p>The armor classes are split as follows: Dragon, AC 2 (flank); Lion, AC 5 (front); Goat, AC 6 (rear).</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>The chimera, being a hybrid, combines the preferences of the lion, the goat, and the dragon in its habitat, society and ecology. The dragonish part of its nature gives the chimera a distinct preference for caves as lairs. The dragon and lion parts seem to war with one another, for some chimerae are dragon-like in their preference for solitude, while others live in small prides. Even if they mate, offspring are rare.</p>
					<p>The monster is an omnivore. The goat head will browse on the toughest plants and shrubs and will derive nutrition from the most barren vegetation while the lion and dragon heads can only be satisfied with flesh. The chimera hunts once every 3 or 4 days, using its strength and limited intelligence to gain an advantage over those it preys on. Having a voracious appetite, it sometimes roams over territories as large as 20 square miles.</p>
					<p>Being chaotic evil in nature, the chimera enjoys preying upon men, elves, dwarves, and halflings. It will even gladly attack other monsters in its search for food. Anyone entering its territory becomes prey, and will be treated accordingly.</p>
					<p>The chimera cannot resist attacking groups of travelers or monsters for another reason: its dragon nature craves the treasure that its prey might be carrying. Although it has no earthly use for it, the chimera will gather the coins of its fallen foe into a heap and roost on it like a dragon. Its hoard is nothing like that of a true dragon, however, and consists mainly of copper and silver coins, with perhaps some jewelry and a few magical items.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>The chimera fills the role of both omnivore and a top predator in its ecosystem. It is very adaptable. During times when its prey is scarce or non-existent, the chimera can make do with a vegetarian diet.</p>
					<p><b>Gorgimera</b></p>
					<p>The gorgimera has the hindquarters of a gorgon, forequarters of a lion, and body and wings of a red dragon. Like the chimera, it has the heads of its three constituent creatures.</p>
					<p>The monster can attack with its claws, bite with its lion and dragon heads, and butt with its gorgon head. In place of making its normal attack, the gorgon and dragon heads can employ their breath weapons. While the dragon's attack is similar to that of the chimera, the gorgon's breath causes petrification to any caught in its area of effect. The gorgon head can use its breath weapon twice per day to strike in a cone 3 feet long which is 1 foot wide at its base and 3 feet wide at its mouth. The gorgimera will always use one of its breath weapons if its foes are within 10 feet. <b><u>A save vs. petrification will allow a victim to avoid the effects of the gorgon's breath </u></b>.</p>
					<p>The gorgon's head can see into both the Astral and Ethereal planes, and its breath weapon extends therein.</p>
					<p>Like its relative the chimera, the gorgimera can also speak a limited form of the language of red dragons.</p>

					<p>The choker is a vicious little monster found in caves and caverns. It has mottled gray or stony brown flesh, and looks more or less humanoid-with two arms, two legs, a torso, and a head. The torso and head are as small and compact as a human baby's, but the arms and legs (and fingers!) are incredibly spindly and long. Stretched to its full length, an adult choker would stand nearly 6 feet tall.</p>
					<p>This creature's limbs are like tentacles, having cartilage but no actual bones, with numerous knobby joints. The cartilage in its fingers juts out through the skin, and is stiff and razor-sharp. Because it lacks bones for support, the choker appears bowlegged and lopes with a strange, fluid gait. The creature is not completely boneless, however; it does have a bony skull, spine, and rib cage.</p>
					<p>Chokers are vaguely intelligent and speak a primitive language.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>A choker seeks out prey by crawling along the crevasses, dry underground river beds, and air shafts that accompany dwarven or other subterranean building sites. Upon finding an opening into an area where dwarves, humans, or humanoids might pass, it lies in wait. When a lone creature arrives, the choker reaches out and begins to strangle it. The intial hit causes <b>1d4 points of damage </b>; thereafter the choker automatically inflicts <b>1d8 points of damage </b>each round as it strangles its victim. The choker's hold can be broken only by killing or incapacitating the creature.</p>
					<p>If the prey puts up too much resistance, however, or the choker has not slain it in 2 to 6 rounds, the creature quickly flees; chokers do not care for extended struggles.</p>
					<p>Once the victim is dead, a choker uses the cutting cartilage on its fingers to came its prey into readily-transportable pieces. Then it carts them all away. If it cannot ambush a victim or is comered by pursuers, a choker lashes out with its sharp fingers, inflicting <b>1d4 points of damage </b>per attack.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Chokers are so primitive that they do not make or use tools. They can carve through solid rock with their fingers, and their lack of bones allows them to squeeze through openings impossible even for creatures of goblin size.</p>
					<p>Because chokers are inherently shy, they would have difficulty locating mates were it not for their special call. To attract a partner, both males and females keen. This whine (which humans and others find extremely irritating) echoes through the deep caverns the chokers call home. When a choker hears the keen of a potential mate, it answers. Then each creature keens in turn to draw the other near, until at last they meet. A few months later, the female gives birth to two to six young. The family stays together for three years, until the offspring have fully matured. Once the offspring have moved on, the parents separate and seek new mates.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>The choker has a high metabolism. It burns an enormous number of calories, especially for a creature of its light weight. Consequently it is always on the lookout for victims on which to feed, and it consumes them rapidly. (A goblin provides about two days' food, for example.)</p>
					<p>Goblins are, in fact, the choker's favorite food. Chokers devour other races, such as dwarves or humans, but prefer the meat of goblins above all else.</p>
					<p>A legend among goblins says that chokers descended from a goblin band which, beset by hardship, turned to cannibalism. Youngsters in this tribe devoured their elders. Over time, the band degenerated. With the twisting of their minds came a reshaping of their bodies; their arms grew long and their fingers steely, enabling them to better grab and strangle prey. They no longer fed upon each other, but continued to crave the flesh of normal goblins.</p>
					<p>As mentioned earlier, chokers can be driven off if their would-be victims prove an able match in combat. In areas infested with chokers, goblins and dwarves also take advantage of the chokers' caution by making a lot of noise, pounding weapons on shields and the like, to scare the chokers away. This tactic sometimes backfires, however, as the noise tends to attract other, more dangerous monsters.</p>

					<p>Cloakers are fiendish horrors, related to trappers, that dwell in dark places far beneath the surface of the earth. They generally seek to kill those who enter their lairs, unless they can think up some other, more amusing way to punish interlopers.</p>
					<p>When a cloaker is first seen, it is almost impossible to distinguish this monster from a common black cloak. The monster's back has two rows of black eye spots running down it that look much like buttons, and the two ivory-colored claws on its upper edge can easily be mistaken for bone clasps.</p>
					<p>When it unfurls itself and moves to attack, however, its true nature becomes all too obvious. At this point, its white underside is clear and the monster's face is fully visible. This face, with the glow of its two piercing, red eyes and the needle-like fangs that line its mouth, is a truly horrible sight. At this point, the monster also uncurls the whip-like tail at its trailing edge and begins to swish it back and forth in anticipation.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>When a cloaker strikes at its victim, it moves with blinding speed. Without warning, the cloaker flies at its target and, if the attack roll is successful, engulfs its prey within its folds. Any creature that falls victim to this attack is all but helpless and can be bitten easily (no roll required) for <b>1d4 points of damage </b>plus the victim's unadjusted Armor Class. Thus, an adventurer in chain mail (AC 5) suffers <b>1d4+5 points of damage </b>each round. Shields offer no protection from such attacks.</p>
					<p>While it is devouring its chosen victim, the cloaker uses its two whip-like tail attacks to inflict <b>1d6 points of damage </b>on those who move in to help rescue the captive. The tail is AC 1 and can be cut off if a total of 16 points of damage are inflicted upon it.</p>
					<p>Any attacks made on the cloaker inflict half their damage to the cloaker and the other half to the trapped victim. Area effect spells, such as fireball, cause full damage to both the monster and its victim.</p>
					<p>The cloaker can also emit a special subsonic moan of increasing intensities. Although this power is blocked by stone or other dense materials, it can be very effective in an open chamber. Cloakers may not moan and bite during the same round. A cloaker may emit one of four types of moan each round. The first intensity of moaning causes unease and numbs the minds of those within 80 feet of the cloaker. The immediate effect of this moan is to cause a -2 penalty to the victims' attack and damage rolls against the cloaker. Further, any creature that is forced to listen to the moan for six consecutive rounds is temporarily forced into a trance that renders it unable to attack or defend itself as long as the moaning continues.</p>
					<p>The second intensity of moaning acts as a <i>fear </i>spell. <b><u>All creatures within 30 feet of the cloaker must roll a successful saving throw vs. spell or flee in terror for two rounds </u></b>.</p>
					<p>The third intensity of moaning causes nausea and weakness and affects all those in a cone 30 feet long and 20 feet wide at its open end. <b><u>Anyone caught in this area must roll a successful saving throw vs. poison or be overcome by nausea and weakness for 1d4+1 rounds </u></b>. During this time, those who fail their saving throws are unable to act in any manner.</p>
					<p>The fourth and final intensity of moaning acts as a <i>hold person </i>spell. This power can be used on only one person at a time, has a range of 30 feet, and lasts for five rounds.</p>
					<p>Each of the various effects of the cloaker's moan can be defeated by the use of a <i>neutralize poison </i>spell on a victim.</p>
					<p>Cloakers also have the power to manipulate shadows. Known as shadow shifting, this power can be used in a number of ways, but in only one particular manner at any given time. The cloaker can employ its shadow shifting ability to obscure its opponents' vision, thus bettering its Armor Class to 1. Or the creature can produce precise images from the shadows that can be used to trick its adversaries. One common means of employing these images is to create a duplicate of the cloaker to draw away enemy attacks. If this method of shadow shifting is employed, it can be treated as a <i>mirror image </i>spell that creates 1d4+2 images.</p>
					<p>A <i>light </i>spell cast directly at a specific cloaker blinds it and prevents it from using its shadow shifting powers.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>The thought processes of cloakers are utterly alien to most other life forms. As such, they can only be communicated with by mages who have devoted long hours to training their minds in the arcane discipline necessary to understand these creatures.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>It is believed that cloakers are asexual, although no definitive proof of this has ever been found.</p>

					<p>The cockatrice is an eerie, repulsive hybrid of lizard, cock, and bat. It is infamous for its ability to turn flesh to stone.</p>
					<p>The cockatrice is about the size of a large goose or turkey, and has the head and body of a cock, with two bat-like wings and the long tail of a lizard tipped with a few feathers. Its feathers are golden brown, its beak yellow, its tail green, and its wings gray. The cockatrice's wattles, comb, and eyes are bright red.</p>
					<p>Females, which are much rarer than males, differ only in that they have no wattles or comb.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>The cockatrice will fiercely attack anything, human or otherwise, which it deems a threat to itself or its lair. When attacking, the cockatrice will attempt to grapple with its foe, touching exposed flesh and turning it to stone. Flocks of cockatrices will do their utmost to overwhelm and confuse their opponents, and they will sometimes fly directly into their victims' faces.</p>
					<p>While the fatal touch of a cockatrice's beak will affect victims clothed in leather or fabric, it will not work through metal armor. The touch will, however, extend into the Ethereal Plane. The cockatrice is somewhat aware of the limits of its powers, and natural selection has taught it to strike only at exposed flesh. If large areas of the opponent's flesh are exposed, it should be assumed that the cockatrice automatically touches flesh. If the target is reasonably well armored, the base chance of a cockatrice striking an area which it can affect is equal to 10% times the adjusted Armor Class of the victim.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>The cockatrice is <b><u>immune to the petrification powers of others of its kind </u></b>.</p>
					<p>The diet of the cockatrice consists of insects, small lizards and the like. When it hunts these animals, the creature does not employ its power to petrify living things.</p>
					<p>It is distinguished from other avians by its unusual habits and nasty temperament. Since females are rare, they are the dominant sex and often have more than one mate. In fact, males fight or strut for the privilege of joining a female's harem. These mated groups usually build their nests in caves. Nest sites are permanent, and the cockatrice constantly seeks to decorate its nesting site by lining it with shining objects like coins and gems.</p>
					<p>Females lay one or two brownish red, rust speckled eggs per month. There is only a 25% chance that any given egg will hatch. Those that are fertile hatch in 11-19 days. The young reach maturity and full power within six months. Once they achieve adulthood, the hatchlings are driven away from the nesting site by their parents. Larger groups of cockatrices encountered will frequently be young driven from the nest who have temporarily united for survival.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>The cockatrice thrives in the wilderness. Its petrification power makes it <b><u>immune to most predators and enables it to compete with other birds for food </u></b>. The feathers of the cockatrice are prized by certain wizards as many magical scrolls must be inscribed with pens made from such quills. Many people also seek unhatched eggs, or even live cockatrices, as unusual pets or guardians.</p>
					<p><b>Pyrolisk</b></p>
					<p>Frequently mistaken for its less malignant relative, the pyrolisk is virtually identical to the cockatrice except for the single red feather in its tail and the reddish cast of its wings. Whereas the cockatrice is motivated by instinct alone, the pyrolisk revels in spreading mayhem. <b><u>Any victims who fail to save vs. death magic when meeting its gaze will instantly burst into flames, dying in agony </u></b>. If the save is made, they are still burnt for 2-13 (1d12+1) points of damage. Any creature within 30 feet innately or magically <b><u>immune to fire will not be affected by its gaze, and anyone who makes their saving throw is thereafter immune to the gaze of that particular pyrolisk </u></b>.</p>
					<p>The creature can cause any fire source within 30 yards to explode in fireworks (as a <i>pyrotechnics </i>spell) once per round.</p>
					<p>The pyrolisk is itself <b><u>immune to all fire-based spells and attacks </u></b>.</p>
					<p>The pyrolisk's mortal enemy is the phoenix, although any creature which the monster encounters is likely to be attacked.</p>

					<p>The couatl are feathered serpents of myth and lore. It is believed that they are distant relatives of dragons, although this remains unproven.</p>
					<p>So rare as to be considered almost legendary, the couatl is one of the most beautiful creatures in existence. It has the body of a long serpent and feathered wings the color of the rainbow. Since it has the ability to <i>polymorph </i>, the couatl will sometimes appear in the form of other creatures (always of good alignment).</p>
					<p>Couatl are able to communicate via telepathy with almost any intelligent creature which they encounter. In addition, they can speak common and most serpent and avian languages.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>A couatl will seldom attack without provocation, though it will always attack evildoers caught red-handed. Whenever possible, a couatl will attack from the air.</p>
					<p>Since it is highly intelligent, the couatl will frequently use its spells from a distance before closing with its foes. If more than one couatl is involved, they will discuss their strategy before a battle. The couatl will also not hesitate to polymorph into another, more effective form in combat.</p>
					<p>The couatl have a variety of abilities which make them more than a match for most other creatures. In addition to being able to <i>polymorph </i>themselves at will, a couatl can use magic. Fully 45% will be 5th level wizards, while 35% can act as 7th level priests. The remaining 20% are able to use both types of abilities.</p>
					<p>In addition to their other magical abilities, couatl can render themselves and up to 450 pounds of additional matter <i>ethereal </i>at will. Further, they can <i>detect good/evil </i>, <i>detect magic </i>, <i>turn invisible </i>, and employ <i>ESP </i>whenever they desire to do so. The oldest and most powerful of couatl can also use a <i>plane shift </i>on themselves and up to 8 others. This ability has a 90% chance of reaching the desired plane.</p>
					<p>The couatl uses its poisonous bite and constriction when forced into melee combat. When it bites it does <b>1-3 points of damage </b>and injects a deadly toxin. <b><u>If the victim fails a save vs. poison it is killed instantly </u></b>. If the constriction attack succeeds, the victim takes <b>2-8 points damage </b>each round until it or the couatl is killed.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>This winged serpent is native to warm, jungle-like regions but can also be found flying through the ether. Their intelligence and goodness have made them objects of reverence by the natives of the regions which they inhabit. Considered to be divine, there are many legends in which the couatl is the benefactor of mankind and the bestower of such precious gifts as agriculture and medicine. There are even shrines in certain areas dedicated to the couatl, and any who attack or harm a couatl are automatically viewed as the blackest of villains.</p>
					<p>Although solitary in nature, couatl think of themselves as a single, extended clan. This clan is led by the oldest and wisest of their numbers but assembles only in dire emergencies.</p>
					<p>Most couatl dwell alone, making their lairs in caves and abandoned buildings in remote, uninhabited regions. They hunt jungle animals for food once every fortnight or so. Many enjoy traveling, often undertaking long journeys of exploration.</p>
					<p>On rare occasions, a pair will mate for life and establish a joint lair. Unlike many other reptiles, the couatl bear live young. Births are rare, averaging only one per couple each century. Both parents participate in the rearing and education of the single offspring, and will fight to the death if their child is threatened. Young couatl reach maturity in thirty or forty years and, though some will elect to remain with their parents for as long as a century, will eventually set off in search of the couatl's never-ending quest for wisdom.</p>
					<p>Intellectually curious, all couatl have vast stores of information and enjoy learning more. When one of them learns some new and fascinating fact he will inevitably set out in search of his brethren to share and discuss it.</p>
					<p>Couatl can sometimes be persuaded to help good adventurers or give sound council. If they feel that they are being sought for frivolous reasons, they will simply fly away. They are not greedy and do not seek treasure for its own sake. Aid from a couatl may well take the form of a magical item from its hoard.</p>

					<p>The crocodile is a large, dangerous predatory reptile native to tropical and subtropical climes. It spends most of its time submerged in swamps, rivers, or other large bodies of water.</p>
					<p>The crocodile is one of the most feared and ugliest predators of the tropics. It has a long, squat body, ranging in size from a scant foot to well over ten feet long. Most mature specimens range from eight to 15 feet long, and some even larger. Many sages argue that crocodiles never stop growing. The crocodile has a long jaw filled with sharp, conical teeth. The powerful maw is superbly adapted for dragging prey beneath the water and dismembering it. Its four short legs are very powerful, and can propel the crocodile rapidly through the water and over the land. Its long tail is also very strong and is sometimes used on land to unbalance its foes.</p>
					<p>The crocodile is covered with a tough horny hide, which blends in very well with the surrounding water. Its eyes and nose are placed so that when the crocodile floats, only they remain above water, enabling the beast to spot and ambush prey. The crocodile is adept at floating through the water and remaining quite still, presenting the illusion that it is nothing more than a floating log.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Ever voracious, hungry crocodiles will attack anything that looks edible, including men. They prefer to lie in wait for their prey (-2 penalty to opponent's surprise roll), and are exceedingly sensitive to movements in the water. They have been known to swiftly and silently swim up to the shore and seize a man, dragging him below the surface of the water. They prefer to attack with their powerful jaws, causing <b>2d4 points of damage </b>, and lash with their tails for <b>1d12 points of damage </b>. Crocodiles will fight among themselves for any prey they seize in their jaws, sometimes tearing their victim to pieces. The only thing that can slow a crocodile is cold. They become slow and sluggish (reduced to 50% of their normal movement) when the temperature falls below 40o F.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Crocodiles sometimes congregate in large numbers, but they are not by nature sociable, nor do they cooperate in hunting. They have well-concealed lairs and will often drag their prey to their lairs before eating it. When a tasty morsel comes its way, a group of crocodiles will go into a feeding frenzy, each attempting to get a part of the feast. They hunt almost daily, primarily in the water, rarely on land. Their tastes are broad: fish, men, small mammals, aquatic birds, and even a careless lion has occasionally been known to fall into their grasp. Hungry crocodiles will sometimes upend boats to see what falls out.</p>
					<p>Crocodiles mate once a year, and the female lays a clutch of about 60 eggs, carefully burying them in the sand. Unlike many other reptiles, the female carefully guards her eggs, protecting them from other predators. When the time comes for the eggs to hatch, the mother assists by digging the eggs out of the sand. The newly hatched young are thrown entirely on their own resources to survive. Very few of the young survive to maturity.</p>
					<p>Swamps and rivers are not the only abode of the crocodile. In recent years there have been dreadful rumors that some of these reptiles have made their homes in the sewers of cities in tropical regions, living on waste and carrion.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>The crocodile is a formidable predator and has little competition for food from other water creatures. One of the few monsters that can compete with it is the dragon turtle. Even on the riverbanks it has little to fear from rival predators; most would prefer not to tangle with a crocodile. The only predator that the crocodile need fear is man, who hunts it for its tough hide, which can be transformed into a beautiful, gleaming leather. Crocodiles are also hunted to eliminate the danger that they represent to riverside communities.</p>
					<p><b>Giant Crocodile</b></p>
					<p>These creatures are far rarer than their smaller cousins. They attain sizes from 21 to 30 feet long, and they also continue to grow until death. Giant crocodiles typically inhabit salt water or prehistoric settings, where they have been know to prey upon sharks, small whales, and small seagoing crafts, such as fishing boats. When attacking a small boat, their favorite technique is to ram it, attempting to capsize and smash it open with their huge jaws. They have been known to gorge upon the catch within the fishing boats, and then to swim away, leaving the fishermen unharmed.</p>

					<p>Dinosaurs are found on alternate planes of existence, or even on lost continents. The frequency figures given are for areas where dinosaurs are normally found; in all other places, they are very rare at best. Dinosaurs, or 'terrible lizards', are reptiles descended from ancestral reptiles called thecodonts. The two types of dinosaurs are saurischians ('lizard-hipped') and ornithischians ('bird-hipped'), named for terms describing their pelvic structures. Within the saurischia are the carnivorous therapods, represented here by tyrannosaurus, and the herbivorous sauropods, represented here by diplodocus. Saurischians also include ornithomimosaurs and the related dromaeosaurs, represented here by deinonychus.</p>
					<p>Many ornithischians have armor, horns, or both. They include ceratopsians, represented by triceratops; ornithopods, such as the hadrosaurs, represented by the lambeosaurus; ankylosaurus; and stegosaurus.</p>
					<p>Dinosaurs come in many sizes and shapes. Those presented here are generally large. Bigger species have drab colors, while smaller dinosaurs have a wide variety of markings. Most dinosaurs have a skin which is pebbly in texture; some closely related species of reptile have fur, and some may have feathers.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Dinosaurs seem to be a mixture of endothermic ('warm-blooded') and exothermic ('cold-blooded'). They regulate body temperature internally, but also depend on external heat somewhat. Though they may be slow on a cold morning, they may not be as slow as a typical reptile.</p>
					<p>Most of these huge reptiles have comparatively small brains, but many of the predators are quite cunning.</p>
					<p>All must eat large amounts of food to maintain their huge bodies. As a result, sauropods eat almost constantly, and carnivores hunt almost constantly and also eat carrion.</p>
					<p>Though the carnivores are both voracious and ferocious, certain plant eaters are very aggressive in their defense, usually with armor or horns. Just because they do not eat meat does not mean they will not kill other animals.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Dinosaurs can be found in almost any type of environment, except desert, high mountains, and frozen wastes. They have no society and little family life, with most species abandoning eggs before they hatch.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Sages do not understand what has made dinosaurs extinct on certain worlds, but they do exist in the 'lost lands' on several worlds. There may be places where dinosaurs have continued to evolve into different forms; they may be ancestors of modern lizard men.</p>
					<p><b>Ankylosaurus</b></p>
					<p>This armadillo-like ornithischian weighs four or five tons, most of this weight being its armor plating, side spines, and great, knobbed tail. If attacked or threatened, this creature lashes out with its tail, delivering blows of considerable force.</p>
					<p>A related species is the paleocinthus, which has better plating (AC -3) and a spiked, rather than club-like, tail.</p>
					<p><b>Deinonychus</b></p>
					<p>This fast carnivore uses its speed, its long, grasping forearms, large teeth, and hind legs with their ripping talons in terrible combination. It hunts by running at prey, leaping, and raking with its rear claws as it claws and bites. The jump is a charge, so the creature gains a +2 on attack rolls. The rear talons count as only one attack, and cause a total of <b>2d6 damage </b>. When attacking a larger creature, the deinonychus often jumps on top of it, and holds on with its front claws while continuing to rake with the rear claws.</p>
					<p>The deinonychus has a relatively large brain for a dinosaur, and its pack hunts with cunning tactics. Despite being 12 feet long, this dinosaur is only about 6 feet tall. Its tail extends straight out behind it, held aloft by an intricate structure of bony supports, thus allowing its 150 pounds of weight to be carried entirely by the back legs.</p>
					<p>The deinonychus is a dromaeosaur, dinosaurs which are related to ornithomimosaurs; its distant relatives include the chicken-sized night hunter, compsognathus, and the ostrich-like struthiomimus. Neither is as formidable as the deinonychus.</p>
					<p><b>Diplodocus</b></p>
					<p>This sauropod lives primarily on water plants, so is often found in or near lakes and marshes. It and related species can also be found on fern prairies and in open forests. It weighs about 10 tons. Though it usually ignores small things, it can step on anything in its way, or even rear up and come down on threatening creatures; this trampling causes <b>3d10 damage </b>. The diplodocus can also whip with its tail for <b>2d8 damage </b>.</p>
					<p>Related species include the huge brachiosaurus, which weighs about 90 tons and averages 75 feet in length. It causes <b>8d10 damage </b>when trampling.</p>
					<p><b>Elasmosaurus</b></p>
					<p>The elasmosaurus looks like a snake with fins and a thick body. It is aggressive, attacking anything it notices. Its neck makes up one-half its total length. The creature is strong, fast, and highly maneuverable, able to turn quickly and lunge at prey. When hunting, the elasmosaurus travels with its head out of the water, snapping down quickly to seize prey.</p>
					<p>This creature's relatives include many other types of plesiosaurs and pliosaurs. Females travel onto sandy beaches to lay their eggs in shallow depressions.</p>
					<p><b>Lambeosaurus</b></p>
					<p>This is a very common 'duck-billed' dinosaur, bipedal, with a flat snout, and crests on its head. A peaceful herbivore, this hadrosaur prefers to run from attack; its only defense is its lashing tail. It has excellent senses, used to detect predators.</p>
					<p>Its enemies include most carnivores. Related species include many other species of duck-billed dinosaurs, as well as the iguanodon. The latter has sharp thumb spikes which can cause <b>1-3 damage </b>each, in addition to its tail attack.</p>
					<p><b>Pteranodon</b></p>
					<p>Although this flying reptile typically dives for marine prey, it attacks any creature that appears to be vulnerable. The pteranodon has no teeth, but spears victims with its beak if they are too large to swallow at a gulp. The beak of a typical pteranodon is about 4 feet long.</p>
					<p>Despite the creature's huge wingspan, its wings are very light, and its furred body is only a little larger than a human being; the whole weighs only about 50 pounds. A pteranodon can carry off prey up to four times its own weight.</p>
					<p>There are all sizes of related species; close relatives have crests on their heads to balance their long beak for flight.</p>
					<p><b>Stegosaurus</b></p>
					<p>Another of the ornithischians, the stegosaurus, or 'plated lizard', is a large, stupid, herbivorous dinosaur with aggressive defenses. It thrives nearly anywhere and is often found on plains or in jungles.</p>
					<p>A stegosaurus is about 8 feet tall at the middle of its back; its humped spine is lined with a double row of leaf-shaped plates which help the creature absorb and dissipate heat. The creature has a spiked tail, with four or more bony spikes of up to 3 feet in length. An enlarged spinal node helps relay commands to the tail and rear legs. The stegosaurus continually turns its posterior towards an enemy, while tucking its head low. It reacts in the same manner if anything near seems threatening.</p>
					<p>Similar species include the dacentrus, which has spikes along its backbone instead of plates, and the kentrosaurus, which has bony plates along the front half of its spine, and spikes along the rear half. All have spiked tails.</p>
					<p><b>Triceratops</b></p>
					<p>The largest of the ceratopsians, or horn-faced dinosaurs, and by far the most aggressive, this beaked herbivore is a plains-dweller. It has a huge front plate of bone protecting its 6-foot-long head, from which project two great horns (each over 3 feet long), while a shorter horn juts from its nose. The head and neck are AC 2; its body is not armored, so is AC 6. The triceratops weighs just over 10 tons.</p>
					<p>Any creature that infringes on the territory of these reptiles is likely to be charged and skewered. Smaller creatures are trampled, suffering <b>2d12 points of damage </b>. The triceratops also uses its horns in fights for dominance within the herd, so it is not unusual to find specimens with past injuries on their heads.</p>
					<p>Related species have the same bony plate which protects their necks, as well as different numbers of horns. The monoclonius has a single nose-horn; the pentaceratops has three true horns, like the triceratops, plus horn-like protrusions jutting from its cheeks; and the styracosaurus has a frill of horns located around the edge of its neck-plate.</p>
					<p><b>Tyrannosaurus</b></p>
					<p>This ravenous creature is one of the most fearsome and terrible of all carnivorous dinosaurs. Despite its huge size and eight-ton weight, the monster is a swift runner. Its huge head is nearly 6 feet long, and its teeth are from 3 to 6 inches in length.</p>
					<p>Tyrannosaurus rex, the 'tyrant lizard king', is a plains dweller, and so relentlessly and stupidly fierce that it will attack a small triceratops, kill it, and swallow its head in one gulp - thus killing itself in a matter of hours as the horns of the victim pierce the stomach of the victor.</p>
					<p>This dinosaur's favorite food is any hadrosaur, such as the trachodon. The monster pursues and eats nearly anything; creatures of man-size or smaller are swallowed whole on a natural attack roll of 18 or higher. The tyrannosaurus also eats carrion, chasing away any smaller creatures to steal a meal found with its keen sense of smell.</p>
					<p>There are many other species of carnosaur, some smaller and faster than tyrannosaurus. Some have stronger arms and more dangerous upper claws.</p>

					<p>Dinosaurs are found on alternate planes of existence, or even on lost continents. The frequency figures given are for areas where dinosaurs are normally found; in all other places, they are very rare at best. Dinosaurs, or 'terrible lizards', are reptiles descended from ancestral reptiles called thecodonts. The two types of dinosaurs are saurischians ('lizard-hipped') and ornithischians ('bird-hipped'), named for terms describing their pelvic structures. Within the saurischia are the carnivorous therapods, represented here by tyrannosaurus, and the herbivorous sauropods, represented here by diplodocus. Saurischians also include ornithomimosaurs and the related dromaeosaurs, represented here by deinonychus.</p>
					<p>Many ornithischians have armor, horns, or both. They include ceratopsians, represented by triceratops; ornithopods, such as the hadrosaurs, represented by the lambeosaurus; ankylosaurus; and stegosaurus.</p>
					<p>Dinosaurs come in many sizes and shapes. Those presented here are generally large. Bigger species have drab colors, while smaller dinosaurs have a wide variety of markings. Most dinosaurs have a skin which is pebbly in texture; some closely related species of reptile have fur, and some may have feathers.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Dinosaurs seem to be a mixture of endothermic ('warm-blooded') and exothermic ('cold-blooded'). They regulate body temperature internally, but also depend on external heat somewhat. Though they may be slow on a cold morning, they may not be as slow as a typical reptile.</p>
					<p>Most of these huge reptiles have comparatively small brains, but many of the predators are quite cunning.</p>
					<p>All must eat large amounts of food to maintain their huge bodies. As a result, sauropods eat almost constantly, and carnivores hunt almost constantly and also eat carrion.</p>
					<p>Though the carnivores are both voracious and ferocious, certain plant eaters are very aggressive in their defense, usually with armor or horns. Just because they do not eat meat does not mean they will not kill other animals.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Dinosaurs can be found in almost any type of environment, except desert, high mountains, and frozen wastes. They have no society and little family life, with most species abandoning eggs before they hatch.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Sages do not understand what has made dinosaurs extinct on certain worlds, but they do exist in the 'lost lands' on several worlds. There may be places where dinosaurs have continued to evolve into different forms; they may be ancestors of modern lizard men.</p>
					<p><b>Ankylosaurus</b></p>
					<p>This armadillo-like ornithischian weighs four or five tons, most of this weight being its armor plating, side spines, and great, knobbed tail. If attacked or threatened, this creature lashes out with its tail, delivering blows of considerable force.</p>
					<p>A related species is the paleocinthus, which has better plating (AC -3) and a spiked, rather than club-like, tail.</p>
					<p><b>Deinonychus</b></p>
					<p>This fast carnivore uses its speed, its long, grasping forearms, large teeth, and hind legs with their ripping talons in terrible combination. It hunts by running at prey, leaping, and raking with its rear claws as it claws and bites. The jump is a charge, so the creature gains a +2 on attack rolls. The rear talons count as only one attack, and cause a total of <b>2d6 damage </b>. When attacking a larger creature, the deinonychus often jumps on top of it, and holds on with its front claws while continuing to rake with the rear claws.</p>
					<p>The deinonychus has a relatively large brain for a dinosaur, and its pack hunts with cunning tactics. Despite being 12 feet long, this dinosaur is only about 6 feet tall. Its tail extends straight out behind it, held aloft by an intricate structure of bony supports, thus allowing its 150 pounds of weight to be carried entirely by the back legs.</p>
					<p>The deinonychus is a dromaeosaur, dinosaurs which are related to ornithomimosaurs; its distant relatives include the chicken-sized night hunter, compsognathus, and the ostrich-like struthiomimus. Neither is as formidable as the deinonychus.</p>
					<p><b>Diplodocus</b></p>
					<p>This sauropod lives primarily on water plants, so is often found in or near lakes and marshes. It and related species can also be found on fern prairies and in open forests. It weighs about 10 tons. Though it usually ignores small things, it can step on anything in its way, or even rear up and come down on threatening creatures; this trampling causes <b>3d10 damage </b>. The diplodocus can also whip with its tail for <b>2d8 damage </b>.</p>
					<p>Related species include the huge brachiosaurus, which weighs about 90 tons and averages 75 feet in length. It causes <b>8d10 damage </b>when trampling.</p>
					<p><b>Elasmosaurus</b></p>
					<p>The elasmosaurus looks like a snake with fins and a thick body. It is aggressive, attacking anything it notices. Its neck makes up one-half its total length. The creature is strong, fast, and highly maneuverable, able to turn quickly and lunge at prey. When hunting, the elasmosaurus travels with its head out of the water, snapping down quickly to seize prey.</p>
					<p>This creature's relatives include many other types of plesiosaurs and pliosaurs. Females travel onto sandy beaches to lay their eggs in shallow depressions.</p>
					<p><b>Lambeosaurus</b></p>
					<p>This is a very common 'duck-billed' dinosaur, bipedal, with a flat snout, and crests on its head. A peaceful herbivore, this hadrosaur prefers to run from attack; its only defense is its lashing tail. It has excellent senses, used to detect predators.</p>
					<p>Its enemies include most carnivores. Related species include many other species of duck-billed dinosaurs, as well as the iguanodon. The latter has sharp thumb spikes which can cause <b>1-3 damage </b>each, in addition to its tail attack.</p>
					<p><b>Pteranodon</b></p>
					<p>Although this flying reptile typically dives for marine prey, it attacks any creature that appears to be vulnerable. The pteranodon has no teeth, but spears victims with its beak if they are too large to swallow at a gulp. The beak of a typical pteranodon is about 4 feet long.</p>
					<p>Despite the creature's huge wingspan, its wings are very light, and its furred body is only a little larger than a human being; the whole weighs only about 50 pounds. A pteranodon can carry off prey up to four times its own weight.</p>
					<p>There are all sizes of related species; close relatives have crests on their heads to balance their long beak for flight.</p>
					<p><b>Stegosaurus</b></p>
					<p>Another of the ornithischians, the stegosaurus, or 'plated lizard', is a large, stupid, herbivorous dinosaur with aggressive defenses. It thrives nearly anywhere and is often found on plains or in jungles.</p>
					<p>A stegosaurus is about 8 feet tall at the middle of its back; its humped spine is lined with a double row of leaf-shaped plates which help the creature absorb and dissipate heat. The creature has a spiked tail, with four or more bony spikes of up to 3 feet in length. An enlarged spinal node helps relay commands to the tail and rear legs. The stegosaurus continually turns its posterior towards an enemy, while tucking its head low. It reacts in the same manner if anything near seems threatening.</p>
					<p>Similar species include the dacentrus, which has spikes along its backbone instead of plates, and the kentrosaurus, which has bony plates along the front half of its spine, and spikes along the rear half. All have spiked tails.</p>
					<p><b>Triceratops</b></p>
					<p>The largest of the ceratopsians, or horn-faced dinosaurs, and by far the most aggressive, this beaked herbivore is a plains-dweller. It has a huge front plate of bone protecting its 6-foot-long head, from which project two great horns (each over 3 feet long), while a shorter horn juts from its nose. The head and neck are AC 2; its body is not armored, so is AC 6. The triceratops weighs just over 10 tons.</p>
					<p>Any creature that infringes on the territory of these reptiles is likely to be charged and skewered. Smaller creatures are trampled, suffering <b>2d12 points of damage </b>. The triceratops also uses its horns in fights for dominance within the herd, so it is not unusual to find specimens with past injuries on their heads.</p>
					<p>Related species have the same bony plate which protects their necks, as well as different numbers of horns. The monoclonius has a single nose-horn; the pentaceratops has three true horns, like the triceratops, plus horn-like protrusions jutting from its cheeks; and the styracosaurus has a frill of horns located around the edge of its neck-plate.</p>
					<p><b>Tyrannosaurus</b></p>
					<p>This ravenous creature is one of the most fearsome and terrible of all carnivorous dinosaurs. Despite its huge size and eight-ton weight, the monster is a swift runner. Its huge head is nearly 6 feet long, and its teeth are from 3 to 6 inches in length.</p>
					<p>Tyrannosaurus rex, the 'tyrant lizard king', is a plains dweller, and so relentlessly and stupidly fierce that it will attack a small triceratops, kill it, and swallow its head in one gulp - thus killing itself in a matter of hours as the horns of the victim pierce the stomach of the victor.</p>
					<p>This dinosaur's favorite food is any hadrosaur, such as the trachodon. The monster pursues and eats nearly anything; creatures of man-size or smaller are swallowed whole on a natural attack roll of 18 or higher. The tyrannosaurus also eats carrion, chasing away any smaller creatures to steal a meal found with its keen sense of smell.</p>
					<p>There are many other species of carnosaur, some smaller and faster than tyrannosaurus. Some have stronger arms and more dangerous upper claws.</p>

					<p>Tyrannosaurus rex, the 'tyrant lizard king', is a plains dweller, and so relentlessly and stupidly fierce that it will attack a small triceratops, kill it, and swallow its head in one gulp - thus killing itself in a matter of hours as the horns of the victim pierce the stomach of the victor.</p>
					<p>This dinosaur's favorite food is any hadrosaur, such as the trachodon. The monster pursues and eats nearly anything; creatures of man-size or smaller are swallowed whole on a natural attack roll of 18 or higher. The tyrannosaurus also eats carrion, chasing away any smaller creatures to steal a meal found with its keen sense of smell.</p>
					<p>There are many other species of carnosaur, some smaller and faster than tyrannosaurus. Some have stronger arms and more dangerous upper claws.</p>

					<p>Smaller than wolves, the appearance of the wild dog varies from place to place. Most appear very wolf-like, while others seem to combine the looks of a wolf and a jackal.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Wild dogs fight as an organized pack. They favor small game, and attack men and human habitations only in times of great hunger. The bite of a wild dog inflicts <b>1-4 points of damage </b>.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Wild dogs are found almost anywhere. They run in packs, and are led by the dominant male. The pack usually hunts a variety of game, even attacking deer or antelope. Pups are born in the spring. Wild dogs can be tamed if separated from their pack.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Wild dogs are omnivores which usually thrive on a combination of hunting and foraging.</p>
					<p><b>War Dogs</b></p>
					<p>Generally large mastiffs or wolfhounds, they have keen senses of smell and hearing, making them adept at detecting intruders. Most war dogs are not usually vicious, and will rarely attack without cause. The status of war dogs varies greatly; some are loyal and beloved pets, some are watch dogs, others are hunting dogs, and some are trained for battle.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Blink Dogs</b></p>
					<p>Blink dogs are yellowish brown canines which are stockier and more muscular than other wild dogs. They are intelligent and employ a limited form of teleportation when they hunt.</p>
					<p>A blink dog attack is well organized. They will blink to and fro without any obvious pattern, using their powers to position themselves for an attack. Fully 75% of the time they are able to attack their targets from the rear. A dog will teleport on a roll of 7 or better on a 12-sided die. To determine where the dog appears, roll a 12-sided die: 1 = in front of opponent, 2 = shielded (or left) front flank, 3 = unshielded (or right) front flank, 4-12 = behind. When blinking, the dog will appear from 1 to 3 feet from its opponent and will immediately be able to attack.</p>
					<p>Blinking is an innate power and the animal will never appear inside a space occupied by a solid object. If seriously threatened, the entire pack will blink out and not return.</p>
					<p>Blink dogs are intelligent, and communicate in a complex language of barks, yaps, whines, and growls. They inhabit open plains and avoid human haunts. A lair will contain 3-12 (3d4) pups 50% of the time (1-2 hit dice, 1-2/1-3 hit points damage/attack). These puppies can be trained and are worth between 1,000 to 2,000 gold pieces.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Death dog</b></p>
					<p>Death dogs are large two-headed hounds which are distinguished by their penetrating double bark. Death dogs hunt in large packs.</p>
					<p>Each head is independent, and a bite does <b>1-10 points of damage </b>. <b><u>Victims must save vs. poison or contract a rotting disease which will kill them in 4-24 (4d6) days </u></b>. Only a cure disease spell can save them. A natural roll of 19 or 20 on their attack die means that a man-sized opponent is knocked prone and attacks at a -4 until able to rise to its feet again. There is an 85% chance that death dogs will attack humans on sight.</p>

					<p>The doppelganger is a master of mimicry that survives by taking the shapes of men, demihumans, and humanoids.</p>
					<p>Doppelgangers are bipedal and generally humanoid in appearance. Their bodies are covered with a thick, hairless gray hide, which gives them a natural AC of 5. They are, however, rarely seen in their true forms.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>This monster is able to assume the shape of any humanoid creature between four and eight feet high. The doppelganger chooses a victim, duplicates his form, and then attempts to kill the original and assume his place. The doppelganger is able to use <i>ESP </i>and can imitate its victim with 90% accuracy, even duplicating the victim's clothing and equipment. If unsuccessful in taking its victim's place, the doppelganger attacks, relying on the ensuing confusion to make it indistinguishable from its victim. A doppelganger is <b><u>immune to </u></b><b><i><u>sleep </u></i></b><b><u>and </u></b><b><i><u>charm </u></i></b><b><u>spells and rolls all saving throws as if he was a 10th-level fighter </u></b>.</p>
					<p>Doppelgangers work in groups and act together to ensure that their attacks and infiltrations are successful. They are very intelligent and usually take the time to plan their attacks with care. If a group of the monsters spots some potential victims, the doppelgangers often trail their targets, waiting for a good chance to strike, choosing their time and opportunity with care. They may wait until nightfall, or until their victims are alone, or even follow them to an inn.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Doppelgangers are rumored to be artificial beings that were created long ago by a powerful wizard or godling. They were originally intended to be used as spies and assassins in an ancient, highly magical war. Their creator died long ago, but they live on, still working as spies for evil powers, thieves, and government. They have even been known to work as assassins.</p>
					<p>All dopplegangers belong to a single tribe. Although this is rare, groups of doppelgangers can be found anywhere at any time, and in unexpected locations. Working as a unit, they select a group of victims, such as a family or a group of travelers. Basically lazy, doppelgangers find it easier to survive and live comfortably by taking humanoid, and especially human, shape. They prefer to take the form of someone comfortably provided for, and shun assuming the form of hardworking peasants. Since they are only 90% accurate in their mimicry, most doppelgangers are eventually discovered and driven out, and then forced once more to assume a new shape.</p>
					<p>Doppelgangers are found most often in their true forms in a dungeon or in the wilderness. Groups often set up a lair in an area well-suited to ambush and surprise, patrolling a regular territory. These bands make a good living by attacking weak humanoid monsters or travelers and stealing their food and treasure. If food and treasure are scarce, they hire out to a powerful wizard or thieves' guild.</p>
					<p>A doppelganger who has been hired to replace a specific person will plan its attack with special care, learning as much about the victim and his environment as it can.</p>
					<p>The doppelgangers' weaknesses are greed and cowardice. They spend their lives in avid pursuit of gold and other wealth. If attacking a group of adventurers, for example, they often choose the richest-looking one to attack first. If they target a party of adventurers, the doppelgangers wait until the party is on the way out of the dungeon and heading back to town. Since they are cowardly, however, they prefer to take the easiest route toward riches. A doppelganger who chooses a rich adventurer avoids risks once the treasure is safely in hand, and retreats at the earliest opportunity, making some plausible excuse for separating from the human members of the group. They sometimes hire out as spies and assassins for money as well.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Doppelgangers are sophisticated and dangerous parasites, living off the labors of others. They must also be reckoned with as clever and effective spies and assassins who can wreak political mayhem in positions of power. Evil wizards have on rare occasions controlled entire kingdoms for short periods of time by replacing a king, prince, or councilor with a doppelganger.</p>

					<p>Dragon turtles are one of the most beautiful, awesome, and feared creatures of the water. With their deadly jaws and breath weapon, and their penchant for capsizing ships, dragon turtles are dreaded by mariners on large bodies of water, both fresh and salt.</p>
					<p>When a dragon turtle surfaces, it is sometimes mistaken for the reflection of the sun or moon on the water. The turtle's rough, deep green shell is much the same color as the deep water the monster favors, and the silver highlights that line the shell are patterned like light dancing on open water. The turtle's legs and tail are of a lighter green, and they are flecked with golden highlights. The coloration of the creature's head is similar to the legs and tail, but its crest spines are golden with dark green webbing connecting them. A dragon turtle's shell can reach to 30 feet in diameter, and an adult turtle can measure over 40 feet from its snout to the tip of its tail. Dragon turtles speak their own highly-developed language.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Though dragon turtles may be mistaken for the pleasant sight of light glinting off of water, that illusion is never maintained for long. Dragon turtles are fierce fighters and will generally attack any creature that threatens its territory or presents itself as a potential meal. In combat, dragon turtles will usually (90%) attack with their formidable claws and teeth first. Its shell provides the turtle with excellent protection, though once the dragon turtle strikes a victim, it rarely needs to rely upon this safeguard.</p>
					<p>The dragon turtle's shell also provides the creature with a weapon to attack ships that foolishly pass through its territory uninvited. Sinking as deep as necessary, the dragon turtle will wait for the ship to pass over it and then rise up underneath the vessel, using all of its considerable bulk to capsize the unlucky target. Ships under 20 feet in length will be capsized by this attack 95% of the time, vessels from 20 to 60 feet long will be capsized 50% of the time, and ships over 60 feet will be capsized 20% of the time. Ships not capsized will sustain some damage.</p>
					<p>In combat, when neither its bite nor its capsizing attack is enough to defeat an enemy, a dragon turtle will use its breath weapon. The turtle can belch forth a cloud of scalding steam that will cover an area 60 feet long, 40 feet wide, and 40 feet high. <b><u>This attack causes 20-120 points of damage </u></b><u>(20d6), and characters or creatures making a saving throw vs. breath weapon take half damage </u>. Like true dragons, dragon turtles can use this deadly breath weapon three times a day.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Dragon turtles are extremely solitary creatures. Large, desolate sea caves and secret underground caverns that can be accessed only through the water are their favorite lairs. These lairs are difficult to find, but adventurers locating a dragon turtle's cave will find it filled with treasures of all types. The turtle gathers this treasure, which it will protect to the death, from the ships sunk in its territory.</p>
					<p>A dragon turtle's territory is well-defined and may cover as much as fifty square miles of open water. Other dragon turtles are allowed into this area only during mating season, though turtles of the same sex will always fight to the death upon meeting. It is this hostility toward their own kind that keeps the number of dragon turtles relatively low.</p>
					<p>Mariners of any experience recognize the territorial claims of dragon turtles and will often make extravagant tributes to the turtle controlling areas necessary for safe and speedy trade.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Dragon turtles are carnivorous and will eat almost any creature, including humans or other dragon turtles, to satisfy their voracious appetite. Large fish seem to be the prefered food for dragon turtles, and the turtles can often be found lurking in the weeds and muck at the bottom of a lake or sea waiting for fish to pass. In particularly poor years for fish, dragon turtles have been known to use their breath weapon to kill large groups of sea birds that stray too close to the water for food.</p>
					<p>Conflict often arises between dragon turtles and the many intelligent aquatic races, like the locathah or mermen, because of competition for ideal lairs. Like many of their land-based relatives, dragon turtles are considered treacherous and selfish by all creatures that share their domain.</p>
					<p>Dragon turtle shells make outstanding shields and armor. Because of the shell's strength and natural resistance to the dragon turtle's own breath weapon, armor or a shield made out of this material gains +1 to its defensive rating. The shield or armor will also save as an item against destruction by fire or steam-based attacks at +4.</p>

					<h>Dragon, General Information</h>
					<p>Dragons are an ancient, winged reptilian race. They are known and feared for their size, physical prowess, and magical abilities. The oldest dragons are among the most powerful creatures in the world.</p>
					<p>Most dragons are identified by the color of their scales. There are many know subspecies of dragons, several of which fall into three broad categories: chromatic, gem, and metallic dragons. Chromatic dragons include black, blue, green, red, and white dragons; all are extremely evil and are feared by most. The metallic dragons are the brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver dragons; these are noble and good, highly respected by wise people.</p>
					<p>The gem dragons are the amethyst, crystal, emerald, sapphire, and topaz dragons; they are neutral with respect to good and evil, and are very charismatic and suave, masters of persuasion who delight in riddles. Though generally smaller and slower than other dragons, gem dragons are often wiser and more intelligent, and have other powers to compensate, like psionics.</p>
					<p>In addition to the dragons in these three classifications, there are other dragons that may at first seem to be members of those categories. For instance, the steel dragon seems to be a metallic dragon, but has only one breath weapon; while each &#147;true&#148; metallic dragon has two. Likewise, the brown dragon seems to be a typical, evil chromatic dragon; but has no wings, so is not a &#147;true&#148; chromatic dragon.</p>
					<p>Although all subspecies of dragons are believed to have come from the same roots tens of thousands of years ago, the present subspecies keep to themselves, working together only under extreme circumstances, such as a powerful mutual threat. Good dragons never work with evil dragons, however, though a few neutral dragon specimens have been known to associate with evil or good dragons. Gold dragons occasionally associate freely with silver dragons, and emerald dragons are sometimes found with sapphire dragons.</p>
					<p>When evil dragons of different species encounter each other, they usually fight to protect their territories. While good dragons of different subspecies are more tolerant of each other, they are also very territorial. They usually try to work out differences in a peaceful manner. Gem dragons often settle inter-species disputes with riddling contests.</p>
					<p>All subspecies of dragons have 12 age categories, and gain more abilities and greater power as they age. Dragons range in size from several feet upon hatching to more than 100 feet, after they have attained the status of great wyrm. The exact size varies according to age and subspecies. A dragon&#146;s wingspan is about equal to its body length; 15-20% of a dragon&#146;s body length is neck.</p>
					<p>Generally, when multiple dragons are encountered they are a mated pair and young. Mated dragons are always young adults, adults, or mature adults; young dragons found with their parents are of the young adult stage or younger. To determine the age of young dragons roll 1d6: 1 = egg; 2 = hatchling; 3 = very young; 4 = young; 5 = juvenile; 6 = young adult.</p>
					<p>During the early part of a dragon&#146;s young adult stage it leaves its parents, greed driving it on to start a lair of its own. Sometimes, although rarely, juvenile dragons leave their parents to start their own lives. As a pair of mated dragons age beyond the mature adult stage, they split up, independence and the lust for treasure driving them apart. Older dragons of either sex sometimes raise young, but only on their own &#150; the other parent leaves when the eggs are laid.</p>
					<p>Dragons, especially older ones, are generally solitary due to necessity and preference. They distance themselves from civilization, which they consider to be a petty and foolish mortal invention.</p>
					<p>Dragons are fearsome predators, but scavenge when necessary and can eat almost anything if they are hungry enough. A dragon&#146;s metabolism operates like a highly efficient furnace, making use of 95% of all the food the dragon eats. A dragon can also metabolize inorganic material, and some dragons have developed a taste for such fare.</p>
					<p>Although dragons&#146; goals and ideals vary among subspecies, all dragons are covetous. They like to hoard wealth, collecting mounds of coins and gathering as many gems, jewels, and magical items as possible. They find treasure pleasing to look at, and they bask in the radiance of the magical items. For a dragon, there is never enough treasure. Those with large hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs only to patrol the immediate areas or to get food. Dragons like to make beds of their treasure, shaping nooks and mounds to fit their bodies. By the time they mature to the great wyrm stage, hundreds of gems and coins are imbedded in their hides.</p>
					<h>Dragon Defenses:</h>
					<p>A dragon&#146;s Armor Class improves as it gets older and the creature becomes tougher. Old dragons or older dragons are immune to normal missiles; their gem-encrusted hides deflect arrows and other small projectiles. Large missiles (from catapults, giants, etc.) and magical missiles affect them normally. Young adult and older dragons radiate a personal aura that makes them partially resistant to harmful magic. A dragon&#146;s resistance to magic increases as it ages.</p>
					<h>Dragon Hide:</h>
					<p>Dragon skin is prized by armorers with the skill to turn it into shields and armor, valuable because of its appearance and the protection it affords. Dragon armor grants its wearer an Armor Class of 4 less than the Armor Class of the dragon it was taken from, for a minimum Armor Class of 8. For example, armor from a juvenile brass dragon (AC O) grants its wearer AC 4. Dragon armor is supple and non-bulky, weighing only 25 pounds.</p>
					<p>The scales of gem dragons take on properties of actual gems; they are faceted and reflect light. They are slightly more brittle than those of other dragons, so armor made from them requires repair more often.</p>
					<p>Dragon armor affords no extra protection, such as resistance to fire or cold, although the armor can be enchanted to provide such protection. A dragon&#146;s resistance to certain elements is based on its total makeup, not just its skin. Plain dragon armor is expensive to make, costing 1,000-10,000 gp, based on the workmanship and protection the armor affords. Dragon skin armor can be enchanted, just as other forms of armor can, to a maximum of +5.</p>
					<p>Dragon shields also offer no additional protection. They are made of stretched hide over a wooden frame. Such shields weigh 3 pounds (if small) or 8 pounds (if large) and cost 20-120 or 30-180 gold pieces.</p>
					<h>Dragon Senses:</h>
					<p>All dragons have excellent senses of sight, smell, and hearing. Their enhanced senses enable them to detect all invisible objects and creatures (including creatures or items hidden in darkness or fog) within a radius equal to 10 feet times their age category. All dragons possess a natural clairaudience ability with respect to their lairs; the range is 20 feet per age category. The dragon must concentrate on a specific section within its lair or surrounding area to hear what is going on.</p>
					<p>Some dragons are able to communicate telepathically with any intelligent creature. The percentage chance for a dragon to speak is based on its Intelligence and age category. Refer to individual descriptions for percentages.</p>
					<h>Dragon Lairs:</h>
					<p>All dragon lairs are far from mortal civilization, and they are difficult to find because the dragons take careful measures to cloak their coming and going. There is usually little, if any, wildlife around the lairs because neighboring creatures fear the dragons, and most dragons eat the few creatures that are foolish enough to remain.</p>
					<p>When a young adult dragon leaves its parents in search of its own lair, it spends a few years moving from place to place to find a cave or cavern which best suits its personality. In most cases, the dragons search for increasingly larger caves which can easily accommodate them as they grow. Usually by the time a dragon has reached the mature adult stage, it has selected a large lair it plans to keep for the remainder of its life. A dragon at this stage has gathered a considerable amount of treasure and is loath to move it to a different location.</p>
					<p>The location and character of dragon lairs vary based on each subspecies; consult individual dragons for specific information. However, one thing remains constant: any dragon considers its lair and neighboring areas its domains. A creature which violates or threatens the lair is threatening the dragon and will be dealt with harshly. Some good dragons may be more lenient than other subspecies in this matter. All dragons keep their treasure hidden deep within their lairs, and some dragons create hazardous conditions within their lain to keep unwary creatures from reaching the treasure.</p>
					<h>Dragon Flight:</h>
					<p>Despite their large size, dragons are graceful and competent fliers; most are maneuverability class C. This is due partially to their powerful wings, and partially to the dragon&#146;s innate magic. Dragons can climb at half speed and dive at double speed.</p>
					<p>A dragon can change direction quickly by executing a wingover maneuver. A dragon cannot gain altitude during the round it executes a wingover, but it may dive. The maneuver enables the dragon to make a turn of 120 to 240 degrees regardless of its speed or size.</p>
					<p>Diving dragons can strike with their claws with a +2 bonus to attack rolls. Dragons diving on land-bound opponents can also strike with both wings, but then must land immediately after attacking. When engaging other flying opponents, dragons can either claw or bite, but not both. An airborne dragon must glide to cast spells (but innate abilities can be used at any time). A gliding dragon loses 1,000 feet of altitude per round, and its forward speed is equal to one half its flight speed on the round before it began gliding.</p>

					<h>Dragon Fear:</h>
					<p>Dragons can <b>inspire panic or fear </b>. The mere sight of a young adult or older dragon <b>causes creatures with fewer than 1 Hit Die </b>(as well as all noncarnivorous, nonaggressive creatures with fewer Hit Dice than the dragon) <b>to automatically flee in panic for </b><b><i><u>4d6 </u></i></b><b>rounds </b>.</p>
					<p>Trained war mounts, organized military units, and single creatures with 1 Hit Die or more, but with fewer Hit Dice than the dragon are not panicked, but they may be stricken with fear if they are within the dragon&#146;s fear aura. The aura surrounds attacking or charging dragons in the specified radius and in a path along the ground directly beneath a flying dragon whose altitude is 250 feet or less. Creatures not automatically panicked are entitled to saving throws vs. petrification. Creatures failing their saving throws are stricken with fear and fight with a -2 penalty to their attack and damage rolls. The aura increases in size and power based on the age category of the dragon; creatures subjected to the aura receive a saving throw bonus or a penalty as specified on the Dragon Table. All creatures with Hit Dice equal to or greater than those of the dragon are immune to the fear effect.</p>
					<p>Gem dragons are not as inherently fearsome as other dragons, so saving throws against their fear auras receive bonuses; the bonuses appear in parenthesis in the Dragon Table.</p>
					<h>Dragon Hit Die Modifier:</h>
					<p>Dragon Hit Dice vary between subspecies and are modified based on age category. Refer to individual dragon entries for the base Hit Dice for each species, and to the Dragon Table for the modifier based on age. The older a dragon gets, the more Hit Dice it has. For example, a black dragon has a base of 10 Hit Dice. A hatchling black dragon subtracts 6 dice, giving it a total of 4. A great wyrm black dragon adds 8 dice for a total of 18.</p>
					<p>Dragons&#146; saving throws are tied to their Hit Dice. Each dragon saves as a fighter equal in level to the dragon&#146;s Hit Dice. For example, a hatchling black dragon saves as a 4th-level fighter, while a great wyrm black dragon saves as an 18th-level fighter.</p>
					<h>Dragon Combat Modifier:</h>
					<p>A dragon&#146;s combat modifier varies with age category. The bonus or penalty applies to damage rolls for each physical attack. It does not apply to a dragon&#146;s breath weapon. The combat modifier is also applied to the dragon&#146;s base spellcasting level (age category), to determine the actual level at which the dragon casts spells (thus, a great wyrm casts spells at 24th level of ability).</p>
					<h>Dragon Attacks:</h>
					<p>All dragons have a <b>claw/claw/bite attack form and a breath weapon </b>. The latter can be used <b>once every three rounds </b>. Dragons also employ several other attack forms which are detailed in the following text. Dragons frequently divide their attacks between opponents, using the more dangerous attacks, such as the bite, against the foes they perceive to be the toughest.</p>
					<p>A dragon&#146;s preferred attacks are usually, in order, breath weapon, magical abilities (or spells), and physical attacks. A dragon that breathes during a round of combat cannot also attack physically. Magical abilities (but not spells) can be used in addition to any attacks, except the breath weapon.</p>
					<p><b>Claws: </b>A dragon can use its claws to attack creatures to its front and sides. If the dragon kicks with one rear leg, it can attack with only one claw (the other must be used to maintain balance).</p>
					<p><b>Bite: </b>Because of a dragon&#146;s long neck, it can bite creatures to its back and sides.</p>
					<p><b>Snatch: </b>Only young adult and older dragons can snatch. This occurs when a flying dragon dives and attempts to grab a creature in one of its claws. A creature struck by this method is taken into the air.</p>
					<p>There is a 50% chance that a snatched creature has its arms pinned, and therefore cannot physically attack the dragon. Snatched creatures are sometimes taken to great heights and dropped. The snatched creature can be squeezed in the claw for automatic claw damage each round, or transferred to the dragon&#146;s mouth (the transfer requires a successful attack roll). If the transfer succeeds, the victim automatically suffers bite damage each round; if it fails, the victim is dropped. Dragons of age old and older can carry a victim in each claw, and they can try to snatch two victims at once. Wyrms and great wyrms can carry three victims, but one of the first two snatched must be transferred from claw to mouth before the third can be snatched.</p>
					<p>A dragon can snatch creatures two or more size categories smaller than itself. For example, a dragon that is 45&#146; long is a Gargantuan creature, so the biggest creature it can snatch is a Large one (12&#146; long).</p>
					<p><b>Plummet: </b>If the DM chooses to allow plummets, an airborne dragon, or a dragon jumping and descending from at least 30 feet above a target, can land on a victim. The dragon crushes and pins opponents using its claws and tail, inflicting damage equal to its bite. The dragon can crush as many creatures as its combat modifier. The dragon rolls a separate attack against each creature affected.</p>
					<p>Creatures that are missed are assumed to have escaped. Creatures that are crushed must roll successful saving throws vs. petrification or be pinned under the dragon, automatically suffering crushing damage during the next round unless the dragon moves off them. If the dragon chooses to maintain the pin, the victims must roll successful saving throws vs. petrification to get free. The dragon&#146;s combat modifier applies as a penalty to all saving throw vs. the crush. A dragon cannot take any other actions when plummeting or pinning.</p>
					<p><b>Kick: </b>Any dragon can kick creatures attacking it from behind. A kick delivers claw damage, and creatures struck must roll their Dexterity or less on 1d20 or be kicked back 1d6 feet,+1 foot per age category of the dragon. Those knocked back must make successful saving throws vs. petrification (adjusted by the dragon&#146;s combat modifier) or fall. If the dragon attacks with one claw, it can kick with only one hind leg (the other must be used for balance). It cannot slap its tail while kicking.</p>
					<p><b>Wing Buffet: </b>Young adult and older dragons can employ their wings in combat; targets must be at the dragon&#146;s sides. The damage inflicted is the same as a claw attack, and creatures struck must roll their Dexterity or less on 1d20 or be knocked prone.</p>
					<p><b>Tail Slap: </b>Adult and older dragons can use their tails to attack creatures to their rear and sides. A tail attack inflicts the same damage as two claw attacks and affects as many targets as the dragon&#146;s age category. The dragon rolls a separate attack against each creature. Creatures struck must roll successful saving throws vs. petrification (adjusted by the dragon&#146;s combat modifier) or be stunned for 1d4+1 minutes. A tail slap can smash a light wooden structure and even damage a cube of force (one charge per two points of combat modifier, round down).</p>
					<p><b>Stall: </b>Any dragon flying near the ground can halt its forward motion and hover for one round; it must land immediately thereafter. Once stopped, the dragon can attack with its bite and all four legs. It can use its breath weapon instead, but this rarely happens since dragons can breathe on the wing. If a dragon stalls in an area with lots of trees or loose earth, the draft from its wings creates a dust cloud with the same radius as its fear aura. Creatures within the cloud are blinded, and no spell casting is possible. The dust lasts for one round.</p>
					<p><b>Spells: </b>Dragons learn spells haphazardly over the years. The DM should randomly determine which spells any particular dragon knows. The dragon can cast each spell once per day, unless random determination indicates the same spell more than once, in which case the dragon can cast it more than once a day. Dragons to not use spell books or pray to deities; they simply sleep, concentrate when they awaken, and remember their spells. Dragon spells have only a verbal component; the spells have a casting time of 1, regardless of level. Dragons cannot physically attack, use their breath weapon, use their magical abilities, or fly (except to glide) while casting a spell.</p>

					<p>Black dragons are abusive, quick to anger, and resent intrusions of any kind. They like dismal surroundings, heavy vegetation, and prefer darkness to daylight. Although not as intelligent as other dragons, black dragons are instinctively cunning and malevolent.</p>
					<p>At birth, a black dragon's scales are thin, small, and glossy. But as the dragon ages, its scales become larger, thicker, and duller, which helps it camouflage itself in swamps and marshes. Black dragons speak their own tongue, a tongue common to all evil dragons, and 10% of hatchling black dragons have an ability to communicate with any intelligent creature. The chance to possess this ability increases 5% per age category of the dragon.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Black dragons prefer to ambush their targets, using their surroundings as cover. Their favorite targets are men, who they will sometimes stalk for several minutes in an attempt to gauge their strength and wealth before attacking. Against a band of men or a formidable creature, of the marsh can weaken the targets before the dragon joins the fight. Black dragons will also use their breath weapon before closing in melee. When fighting in heavily vegetated swamps and marshes, black dragons attempt to stay in the water or along the ground; the numerous trees and leafy canopies limit their flying maneuverability. When faced with an opponent which poses too much of a threat, a black dragon will attempt to fly out of sight, so it will not leave tracks, and hide in a deep pond or bog.</p>
					<p>Breath Weapon/Special Abilities:</p>
					<p>A black dragon's breath weapon is a 5' wide stream of acid that extends 60' in a straight line from the dragon's head. <b><u>All creatures caught in this stream must save vs. breath weapon for half damage </u></b>. A black dragon casts spells and uses its magical abilities at 5th level, plus its combat modifier.</p>
					<p>Black dragons are born with an innate water breathing ability and an <b><u>immunity to acid </u></b>. As they age, they gain the following additional powers:</p>
					<p><i>Juvenile: darkness </i>three times a day in a 10' radius per age category of the dragon. <i>Adult: corrupt water </i>once a day. For every age category a dragon attains, it can stagnate 10 cubic feet of water, making it become still, foul, inert, and unable to support animal life. When this ability is used against potions and elixirs, they become useless if they roll a 15 or better on 1d20. <i>Old: plant growth </i>once a day. Venerable: <i>summon insects </i>once a day. <i>Great wyrm: charm reptiles </i>three times a day. This operates as a <i>charm mammals </i>spell, but is applicable only to reptiles.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Black dragons are found in swamps, marshes, rain forests, and jungles. They revel in a steamy environment where canopies of trees filter out most of the sunlight, swarms of insects fill the air, and stagnant moss-covered ponds lie in abundance. Black dragons are excellent swimmers and enjoy lurking in the gloomy depths of swamps and bogs. They also are graceful in flight; however, they prefer to fly at night when their great forms are hidden by the darkness of the sky. Black dragons are extremely selfish, and the majority of those encountered will be alone. When a family of black dragons is encountered, the adults will protect their young. However, if it appears the adults' lives are in jeopardy they will abandon their young to save themselves.</p>
					<p>They lair in large, damp caves and multi-chambered subterranean caverns. Older dragons are able to hide the entrance to their lairs with their <i>plant growth </i>ability. Black dragons are especially fond of coins. Older black dragons sometimes capture and question humans, before killing them, to find out where stockpiles of gold, silver, and platinum coins are kept.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Black dragons can eat almost anything, although they prefer to dine primarily on fish, mollusks, and other aquatic creatures. They are fond of eels, especially the giant varieties. They also hunt for red meat, but they like to 'pickle' it by letting it lie in ponds within their lair for days before eating it.</p>

					<p>Blue dragons are extremely territorial and voracious. They love to spend long hours preparing ambushes for herd animals and unwary travelers, and they spend equally long hours dwelling on their success and admiring their trophies.</p>
					<p>The size of a blue dragon's scales increases little as the dragon ages, although they do become thicker and harder. The scales vary in color from an iridescent azure to a deep indigo, retaining a glossy finish through all of the dragon's stages because the blowing desert sands polish them. This makes blue dragons easy to spot in barren desert surroundings. However, the dragons often conceal themselves, burrowing into the sand so only part of their heads are exposed.</p>
					<p>Blue dragons love to soar in the hot desert air; usually flying in the daytime when temperatures are the highest. Some blue dragons nearly match the color of the desert sky and use this coloration to their advantage in combat.</p>
					<p>Blue dragons speak their own tongue, a tongue common to all evil dragons, and 12% of hatchling blue dragons have an ability to communicate with any intelligent creature. The chance to possess this ability increases 5% per age category of the dragon.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Blue dragons prefer to fight from a distance so their opponents can clearly witness the full force of their breath weapon and so little or no threat is posed to themselves. Often blue dragons will attack from directly above or will burrow beneath the sands until opponents come within 100 feet. Older blue dragons will use their special abilities, such as <i>hallucinatory terrain </i>, in concert with these tactics to mask the land and aid in their chances to surprise. Blue dragons will only run from a fight if they are severely damaged, since they view retreat as cowardly.</p>
					<p>Breath Weapon/Special Abilities:</p>
					<p>A blue dragon's breath weapon is a 5' wide bolt of lightning that streaks 100' in a straight line from the dragon's mouth. <b><u>All creatures caught in this stream must save vs. breath weapon for half damage </u></b>. Blue dragons cast spells and use their magical abilities at 7th level, adjusted by their combat modifier.</p>
					<p>Blue dragons are born with an <b><u>immunity to electricity </u></b>. As they age, they gain the following additional powers:</p>
					<p><i>Young: create </i>or <i>destroy water </i>three times per day. <i>Juvenile: sound imitation </i>at will. <i>Adult: dust devil </i>once a day. <i>Old: ventriloquism </i>once a day. <i>Venerable: hallucinatory terrain </i>once a day.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Blue dragons are found in deserts; arid, windswept plains; and hot humid badlands. They enjoy the bleak terrain because there are few obstacles - only an occasional rock outcropping or dune - to interrupt the view of their territories. They spend hours looking out over their domains, watching for trespassers and admiring their property. Most of the blue dragons encountered will be alone because they do not want to share their territories with others. However, when a family is encountered the male dragon will attack ferociously, protecting his property-his mate and young. The female dragon also will join in the attack if the threat proves significant.</p>
					<p>Blue dragons' enemies are men, who kill the dragons for their skin and treasure, and brass dragons, which share the same environment. If a blue dragon discovers a brass dragon in the same region, it will not rest until the trespassing dragon is killed or driven away.</p>
					<p>Blue dragons lair in vast underground caverns in which they store their treasure. Although blue dragons will collect anything which looks valuable, they are fond of gems - especially sapphires.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Blue dragons are able to consume nearly anything, and sometimes are forced to eat snakes, lizards, and desert plants to help sate their great hunger. However, they are particularly fond of herd animals, such as camels, and they will gorge themselves on caravans of the creatures which they cook with a <i>lightning bolt </i>.</p>

					<p>Green dragons are bad tempered, mean, cruel, and rude. They hate goodness and good-aligned creatures. They love intrigue and seek to enslave other woodland creatures, killing those who cannot be controlled or intimidated.</p>
					<p>A hatchling green dragon's scales are thin, very small, and a deep shade of green that appears nearly black. As the dragon ages, the scales grow larger and become lighter, turning shades of forest, emerald, and olive green, which helps it blend in with its wooded surroundings. A green dragon's scales never become as thick as other dragons', remaining smooth and flexible.</p>
					<p>Green dragons speak their own tongue, a tongue common to all evil dragons, and 12% of hatchling green dragons have an ability to communicate with any intelligent creature. The chance to possess this ability increases 5% per age category of the dragon.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Green dragons initiate fights with little or no provocation, picking on creatures of any size. If the target creature intrigues the dragon or appears to be difficult to deal with, the dragon will stalk the creature, using its environment for cover, until it determines the best time to strike and the most appropriate tactics to use. If the target appears formidable, the dragon will first attack with its breath weapon, magical abilities, and spells. However, if the target appears weak, the dragon will make its presence known quickly for it enjoys evoking terror in its targets. When the dragon has tired of this game, it will bring down the creature using its physical attacks so the fight lasts longer and the creature's agony is prolonged.</p>
					<p>Sometimes, the dragon elects to control a creature, such as a human or demi-human, through intimidation and suggestion. Green dragons like to question men, especially adventurers, to learn more about their society, abilities, what is going on in the countryside, and if there is treasure nearby.</p>
					<p>Breath Weapon/Special Abilities:</p>
					<p>A green dragon's breath weapon is a cloud of poisonous chlorine gas that is 50' long, 40' wide, and 30 feet high. <b><u>Creatures within the cloud may save versus breath weapon for half damage </u></b>. A green dragon casts its spells at 6th level, adjusted by its combat modifier.</p>
					<p>From birth, green dragons are <b><u>immune to gasses </u></b>. As they age, they gain the following additional powers:</p>
					<p><i>Juvenile: water breathing </i>. <i>Adult: suggestion </i>once a day. <i>Mature adult: warp wood </i>three times a day. <i>Old: plant growth </i>once a day. <i>Very old: entangle </i>once a day. Wyrm: <i>pass without trace </i>three times a day.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Green dragons are found in sub-tropical and temperate forests, the older the forest and bigger the trees, the better. The sights and smells of the woods are pleasing to the dragon, and it considers the entire forest or woods its territory. Sometimes the dragon will enter into a relationship with other evil forest-dwelling creatures, which keep the dragon informed about what is going on in the forest and surrounding area in exchange for their lives. If a green dragon lives in a forest on a hillside, it will seek to enslave hill giants, which the dragon considers its greatest enemy. A green dragon makes its lair in underground chambers far beneath its forest.</p>
					<p>The majority of green dragons encountered will be alone. However, when a mated pair of dragons and their young are encountered, the female will leap to the attack. The male will take the young to a place of safety before joining the fight. The parents are extremely protective of their young, despite their evil nature, and will sacrifice their own lives to save their offspring.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Although green dragons have been known to eat practically anything, including shrubs and small trees when they are hungry enough, they especially prize elves. If the forest is on a hillside, hill giants will hunt the younger dragons, which they consider a delicacy.</p>

					<p>Red dragons are the most covetous and greedy of all dragons, forever seeking to increase their treasure hoards. They are obsessed with their wealth and memorize an inventory accurate to the last copper. They are exceptionally vain and self confident, considering themselves superior not only to other dragons, but to all other life in general.</p>
					<p>When red dragons hatch, their small scales are a bright glossy scarlet. Because of this, they can be quickly spotted by predators and men hunting for skins, so they are hidden in deep underground lairs and not permitted to venture outside until toward the end of their <i>young </i>stage when their scales become turned a deeper red, the glossy texture has been replaced by a smooth, dull finish, and they are more able to take care of themselves. As the dragon continues to age, the scales become large thick, and as strong as metal.</p>
					<p>Red dragons speak their own tongue, a tongue common to all evil dragons, and 16% of hatchling red dragons have an ability to communicate with any intelligent creature. The chance to possess this ability increases 5% per age category of the dragon.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Because red dragons are so confident, they never pause to appraise an adversary. When they notice a target they make a snap decision whether to attack, using one of many 'perfect' strategies worked out ahead of time in the solitude of their lairs. If the creature appears small and insignificant, such as an unarmored man, the dragon will land to attack with its claws and bite, not wanting to obliterate the creature with its breath weapon, as any treasure might be consumed by the flames. However, if a red dragon encounters a group of armored men, it will use its breath weapon, special abilities, and spells (if it is old enough to have them) before landing.</p>
					<p>Breath Weapon/Special Abilities:</p>
					<p>A red dragon's breath weapon is a searing cone of fire 90' long, 5' wide at the dragon's mouth and 30' at the base. <b><u>Creatures struck by the flames must save versus breath weapon for half damage </u></b>. Red dragons cast spells at 9th level, adjusted by their combat modifiers.</p>
					<p>Red dragons are born <b><u>immune to fire </u></b>. As they age, they gain the following additional powers:</p>
					<p><i>Young: affect normal fires </i>three times per day. <i>Juvenile: pyrotechnics </i>three times per day. <i>Adult: heat metal </i>once per day. <i>Old: suggestion </i>once per day. <i>Very old: hypnotism </i>once per day. <i>Venerable: detect gems, kind and number </i>in a 100' radius three times a day.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Red dragons can be found on great hills or on soaring mountains. From a high perch they haughtily survey their territory, which they consider to be everything that can be seen from their position. They prefer to lair in large caves that extend deep into the earth.</p>
					<p>A red dragon enjoys its own company, not associating with other creatures, or even other red dragons, unless the dragon's aims can be furthered. For example, some red dragons who have <i>charm </i>spells will order men to act as the dragon's eyes and ears, gathering information about nearby settlements and sources of treasure. When a red dragon's offspring reach the <i>young adult </i>stage, they are ordered form the lair and the surrounding territory, as they are viewed as competition.</p>
					<p>Red dragons are quick to fight all creatures which encroach on their territory, especially copper and silver dragons which sometimes share the same environment. The hate gold dragons above all else because they believe gold dragons are 'nearly' as powerful as themselves.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Red dragons are meat eaters, although they are capable of digesting almost anything. Their favorite food is a maiden of any human or demi-human race. Sometimes the dragons are able to charm key villagers into regularly sacrificing maidens to them.</p>

					<p>White dragons, the smallest and weakest of the evil dragons, are slow witted but efficient hunters. They are impulsive, vicious, and animalistic, tending to consider only the needs and emotions of the moment and having no foresight or regret. Despite their low intelligence, they are as greedy and evil as the other evil dragons.</p>
					<p>The scales of a hatchling white dragon are a mirror-like glistening ground. As the dragons ages, the sheen disappears, and by the time it reaches the very old stage, scales of pale blue and light gray are mixed in with the white.</p>
					<p>White dragons speak their own tongue, a tongue common to all evil dragons, and 7% of hatchling white dragons have an ability to communicate with any intelligent creature. The chance to possess this ability increases 5% per age category of the dragon.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Regardless of a target's size, a white dragon's favorite method of attack is to use its breath weapon and special abilities before closing to melee. This tactic sometimes works to the dragon's detriment, as it can exhaust its breath weapon on smaller prey and then be faces with a larger creature it must attack physically. If a white dragon is pursuing creatures in the water, such as polar bears or seal, it will melee them in their element, fighting with its claws and bite.</p>
					<p>Breath Weapon/Special Abilities:</p>
					<p>A white dragon's breath weapon is a come of frost 70' long, 5' wide at the dragon's mouth, and 25' wide at the base. <b><u>Creatures caught in the blast may Save versus Breath Weapon for half damage </u></b>. A white dragon casts its spells and uses its magical abilities at 5th level, plus its combat modifier.</p>
					<p>From their birth, white dragons are <b><u>immune to cold </u></b>. As they grow older, they gain the following additional abilities:</p>
					<p><i>Juvenile: ice walking </i>, which allows the dragon to walk across ice as easily as easily as creatures walk across flat, dry ground. <i>Mature adult: gust of wind </i>three times a day. <i>Very old: wall of fog </i>three times a day, this produces snow or hail rather than rain. <i>Wyrm: freezing fog </i>three times a day. This obscures vision in a 100' radius and causes frost to form, creating a thin layer of glare ice on the ground and on all surfaces within the radius.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>White dragons live in chilly or cold regions, preferring lands where the temperature rarely rises above freezing and ice and snow always cover the ground. When temperatures become too warm, the dragons become lethargic. White dragons bask in the frigid winds that whip over the landscape, and they wallow and play in deep snow banks.</p>
					<p>White dragons are lackadaisical parents. Although the young remain with the parents from <i>hatchling </i>to <i>juvenile </i>or <i>young adult </i>stage they are not protected. Once a dragon passes from it <i>hatchling </i>stage, it must fend for itself, learning how to hunt and defend itself, learning how to hunt and defend itself by watching the parents.</p>
					<p>White dragons' lairs are usually icy caves and deep subterranean chambers; they select caves that open away from the warming rays of the sun. White dragons store all of their treasure within their lair, and prefer keeping it in caverns coated in ice, which reflect the gems, especially diamonds, because they are pretty to look at.</p>
					<p>Although white dragons, as all other dragons, are able to eat nearly anything, they are very particular and will consume only food which has been frozen. Usually after a dragon has killed a creature with its breath weapon it will fall to devouring it while the carcass is still stiff and frigid. It will bury other kills in snow banks until they are suitably frozen.</p>
					<p>White dragons' natural enemies are frost giants who kill the dragons for food and armor and subdue them for guards and mounts.</p>

					<p>Brass dragons are great talkers, but not particularly good conversationalists. They are egotistical and often boorish. They oftern have useful information, but will divulge it only after drifting off the subject many times and after hints that a gift would be appreciated.</p>
					<p>At birth, a brass dragon's scales are dull. Their color is a brassy, mottled brown. As the dragon gets older, the scales become more brassy, until they reach a warm burnished appearance.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Brass dragons would rather talk than fight. If an intelligent creature tries to take its leave of a brass dragon without talking to it at length, the dragon might have a fit of pique and try to force a conversation with suggestion or by giving the a dose of sleep gas. If the victim falls asleep it will awaken to find itself pinned under the dragon or buried to the neck in the sand until the dragon's thirst for small talk is slaked. Before melee, brass dragons create a cloud of dust with <i>dust devil </i>or <i>control winds </i>, then charge or snatch. Brass dragons often use <i>control temperature </i>to create heat to discomfort their opponents. When faced with real danger, younger brass dragons will fly out of sight, then hide by burrowing. Older dragons spurn this ploy.</p>
					<p>Breath Weapon/Special Abilities:</p>
					<p>A brass dragon has two breath weapons: a cone of sleep gas 70' long, 5' wide at the dragon's mouth, and 20' wide at its end; or a cloud of blistering desert heat 50' long, 40' wide, and 20' high. <b><u>Creatures caught in the gas, regardless of Hit Dice or level, must save vs. breath weapon for half </u></b>. A brass dragon casts its spells and uses its magical abilities at 6th level, plus its combat modifier.</p>
					<p>At birth, brass dragons can <i>speak with animals </i>freely, and are <b><u>immune to fire and heat </u></b>. As they age, they gain the following additional powers:</p>
					<p><i>Young: create or destroy water </i>three times a day. <i>Juvenile: dust devil </i>once a day. <i>Adult: suggestion </i>once a day. <i>Mature adult: control temperature </i>three times a day in a 10' radius per age level. <i>Old: control winds </i>once a day. <i>Great wyrm: Summon djinni </i>once a week. The dragon usually asks the djinni to preform some service. Although the djinni serves willingly, the dragon will order it into combat only in extreme circumstances, as the dragon would be dismayed and embarrassed if the djinni were killed.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Brass dragons are found in arid, warm climates; ranging from sandy deserts to dry steppes. They love intense, dry heat and spend most of their time basking in the sun. They lair in high caves, preferably facing east where the sun can warm the rocks, and their territories always contain several spots where they can bask and trap unwary travelers into conversation.</p>
					<p>Brass dragons are very social. They usually are on good terms with neighboring brass dragons and sphinxes. Brass dragons are dedicated parents. If their young are attacked they will try to slay the enemy, using their heat breath weapons and taking full advantage of their own immunity.</p>
					<p>Because they share the same habitat, blue dragons are brass dragons' worst enemies. Brass dragons usually get the worst of a one-on-one confrontation, mostly because of the longer reach of the blue dragon's breath weapon. Because of this, brass dragons usually try to evade blue dragons until they can rally their neighbors for a mass attack.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Like other dragons, brass dragons can, and will, eat almost anything if the need arises. In practice, however, they eat very little. They are able to get nourishment from the morning dew, a rare commodity in their habitat, and have been seen carefully lifting it off plants with their long tongues.</p>

					<p>Bronze dragons are inquisitive and fond of humans and demi-humans. They enjoy <i>polymorphing </i>into small, friendly animals so they can unobtrusively observe humans and demi-humans, especially adventurers. Bronze dragons thrive on simple challenges such as riddles and harmless contests. They are fascinated by warfare and will eagerly join an army if the cause is just and the pay is good.</p>
					<p>At birth, a bronze dragon's scales are yellow tinged with green, showing only a hint of bronze. As the dragon approached adulthood, its color deepens slowly changing to a rich bronze tone that gets darker as the dragon ages. Dragons from the very old stage on develop a blue-black tint to the edges of their scales, similar to a patina on ancient bronze armor or statues.</p>
					<p>Bronze dragons speak their own tongue, a tongue common to all good dragons, and 16% of hatchling bronze dragons have an ability to communicate with any intelligent creature. The chance to possess this ability increases 5% per age category of the dragon.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Bronze dragons dislike killing creatures with animal intelligence and would rather bribe them (perhaps with food), or force them away with repulsion. When confronted with intelligent opponents bronze dragons use their <i>ESP </i>ability to learn their opponents' intentions. When attacking they blind their opponents with <i>wall of fog </i>, then charge. Or, if they are flying they will snatch opponents. When fighting under water, they use <i>airy water </i>to maintain the effectiveness of their breath weapons, and to keep away purely aquatic opponents. Against boats or ship they <i>summon </i>a storm or use their tail slap to smash the vessels' hulls. If the dragon is inclined to be lenient, seafaring opponents might merely find themselves becalmed, fog bound, or with broken masts.</p>
					<p>Breath Weapon/Special Abilities:</p>
					<p>A bronze dragon has two breath weapons: a stroke of lightning 100' long and 5' side or a cloud of repulsion gas 20' long, 30' wide, and 30' high. <b><u>Creatures caught in the gas must save vs. breath weapon or move away from the dragon for two minutes per age level of the dragon, plus 1-6 minutes </u></b>. <b><u>Creature caught in the lightning take damage, save vs. breath weapon for half </u></b>. A bronze dragon casts its spells and uses its magical abilities at 8th level, plus its combat modifier.</p>
					<p>At birth, bronze dragons have a water breathing ability, can speak with animals at will, and are <b><u>immune to electricity </u></b>. As they age, they gain the following additional powers:</p>
					<p><i>Young: create food and water </i>and <i>polymorph self </i>three times a day. (Each change in form lasts until the dragon chooses a different form. Reverting to the dragon's normal form does not count as a change.) <i>Juvenile: wall of fog </i>once a day. <i>Adult: ESP </i>three times a day. <i>Mature adult: airy water </i>three times a day in a 10' radius per age category of the dragon. <i>Old: weather summoning </i>once a day.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Bronze dragons like to be near deep fresh or salt water. They are good swimmers and often visit the depths to cool off or to hunt for pearls or treasure from sunken ships. They prefer caves that are accessible only from the water, but their lairs are always dry - they do not lay eggs, sleep, or store treasure under water.</p>
					<p>Bronze dragons are fond of sea mammals, especially dolphins and whales. These animals provide the dragons with a wealth of information on shipwrecks, which the dragons love to plunder, and detail the haunts of large sharks. Bronze dragons detest pirates, disabling or destroying their ships.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Bronze dragons eat aquatic plants and some varieties of seafood. They especially prize of shark meat. They also dine on an occasional pearl, and, like other dragons, can eat almost anything in a pinch. Evil, amphibious sea creatures (particularly sahuagin), who can invade their air filled lairs, are their greatest enemies.</p>

					<p>Copper dragons are incorrigible pranksters, joke tellers, and riddlers. They are prideful and are not good losers, although they are reasonable good winner. They are particularly selfish, and greedy for their alignment, and have an almost neutral outlook where wealth is concerned.</p>
					<p>At birth, a copper dragon's scales have a ruddy brown color with a copper tint. As the dragon gets older, the scales become finer and more coppery, assuming a soft, warm gloss by the time the dragon becomes a young adult. Beginning at the <i>venerable </i>stage, the dragons' scales pick up a green tint.</p>
					<p>Copper dragons speak their own tongue, a tongue common to all good dragons, and 14% of hatchling copper dragons have an ability to communicate with any intelligent creature. The chance to possess this ability increases 5% per age category of the dragon.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Copper dragons like to taunt and annoy their opponents, hoping they will give up or become angry and act foolishly. Early in an encounter, a copper dragon will jump from one side of an opponent to another, landing on inaccessible or vertical stone surfaces. If there are no such places around a dragon's lair, the dragon will create them ahead of time using <i>stone shape </i>, <i>move earth </i>, and <i>wall of stone </i>. An angry copper dragon will mire its opponents using <i>rock to mud </i>, and will force victims who escape the mud into it with kicks. Once opponents are trapped in the mud, the dragon will crush them with a <i>wall of stone </i>or snatch them and carry them aloft. When fighting airborne opponents, a dragon will draw its enemies into narrow, stony gorges where it can use its spider climb ability in an attempt to maneuver the enemy into colliding with the walls.</p>
					<p>Breath Weapon/Special Abilities:</p>
					<p>A copper dragon's breath is either a cloud of slow gas 30' long, 20' wide, and 20' high or a spurt of acid 70' long and 5' wide. Creatures caught in the gas must save vs breath weapon or be slowed for three minutes per age level of the dragon. <b><u>Creatures caught in the acid take damage, save vs. breath weapon for half </u></b>. A copper dragon cast its spells and uses its magical abilities at 7th level, plus its combat modifier.</p>
					<p>At birth, copper dragons can <i>spider climb </i>(stone surfaces only) and are <b><u>immune to acid </u></b>. As they age, they gain the following additional powers:</p>
					<p><i>Young: neutralize poison </i>three times a day. <i>Juvenile: stone shape </i>twice a day. <i>Adult: forget </i>once a day. <i>Mature adult: rock to mud </i>once a day. <i>Old: move earth </i>once a day. <i>Great wyrm: wall of stone </i>once a day. A copper dragon can jump 30 yards forward or sideways, reaching heights up to 20' at mid jump. They can jump 30' straight up.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Copper dragons like dry, rocky uplands and mountains. They lair in narrow caves and often conceal the entrances using move earth and stone shape. Within the lair, they construct twisting mazes with open tops. These allow the dragon to fly or jump over intruders struggling through the maze.</p>
					<p>Copper dragons appreciate wit, and will usually leave good or neutral creatures alone if they can relate a joke, humorous story, or riddle the dragon has not heard before. They quickly get annoyed with creatures who don't laugh at their joked or do not accept the dragon's tricks and antics with good humor.</p>
					<p>Because they often inhabit hills in sight of red dragons' lairs conflicts between the two subspecies often occur. Copper dragons usually run for cover until they can equal the odds.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Copper dragons are determined hunters, the good sport a hunt provides is at least as important as the food they get. They are known to eat almost anything, including metal ores. However, they prize giant scorpions and other large poisonous creatures (they say the venom sharpens their wit). The dragon's digestive system can handle the venom safely, although injected venoms affect them normally.</p>

					<p>Gold dragons are wise, judicious, and benevolent. They often embark on self-appointed quests to promote goodness, and are not easily distracted from them. They hate injustice and foul play. A gold dragon frequently assumes human or animal guise and usually will be encountered disguised.</p>
					<p>At birth, a gold dragon's scales are dark yellow with golden metallic flecks. The flecks get larger as the dragon matures until, at the adult stage, the scales grow completely golden.</p>
					<p>Gold dragons speak their own tongue, a tongue common to all good dragons, and 18% of hatchling gold dragons have an ability to communicate with any intelligent creature. The chance to possess this ability increases 5% per age category of the dragon.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Gold dragons usually parley before combat. When conversing with intelligent creatures they use <i>detect lie </i>and <i>detect gems </i>spells to gain the upper hand. In combat, they quickly use <i>bless </i>and <i>luck bonus </i>. Older dragons use <i>luck bonus </i>at the start of each day if the duration is a day or more. They make heavy use of spells in combat. Among their favorites are <i>sleep </i>, <i>stinking cloud </i>, <i>slow </i>, <i>fire shield </i>, <i>cloudkill </i>, <i>globe of invulnerability </i>, <i>delayed blast </i>, <i>fireball </i>, and <i>maze </i>.</p>
					<p>Breath Weapon/Special Abilities:</p>
					<p>A gold dragon has two breath weapons: a cone of fire 90' long, 5' wide at the dragon's mouth, and 30' wide at the end or a cloud of potent chlorine gas 50' long, 40' wide and 30' high. <b><u>Creatures caught in either effect are entitled to a save versus breath weapon for half damage </u></b>.</p>
					<p>At birth, gold dragons have <i>water breathing </i>ability, can <i>speak with animals </i>freely, and are <b><u>immune to fire and gas </u></b>. They can also <i>polymorph self </i>three times a day. Each change form lasts until the dragon chooses a different form; reverting to the dragon's normal form does not count as a change. A gold dragon's natural form has wings. However, they sometimes choose a wingless form to facilitate swimming, gaining the higher swimming rate listed above. A gold dragon in any wingless form can fly at a speed of 6 (MC E).</p>
					<p>As they age, they gain the following additional powers:</p>
					<p><i>Young: bless </i>three times a day. <i>Juvenile: detect lie </i>three times a day. <i>Adult: animal summoning </i>once a day. <i>Mature adult: luck bonus </i>once a day. <i>Old: quest </i>once a day, and <i>detect gems </i>three times a day. (This allows the dragon to know the number and kind of precious stones within a 30' radius, duration is one minute.</p>
					<p>The <i>luck bonus </i>power of <i>mature adults </i>is used to aid good adventurers. By touch the dragon can enchant one gem to bring good luck. The gem is usually one which has been embedded in the dragon's hide. When the dragon carries the gem, it and every good creature in a 10' radius per age category of the dragon receives a +1 bonus to all Saving Throws and similar dice rolls, cf. <i>stone of good luck </i>. If the dragon gives a gem to another creature only the bearer gets the bonus. The enchantment lasts three hours per age category of the dragon, plus 1-3 hours. The enchantment ends if the gem is destroyed before its duration expires.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Gold dragons can live anywhere. Their lairs are secluded and always made of solid stone, either caves or castles. These usually have loyal guards: either animals appropriate to the terrain, or storm or good cloud giants. The giants usually serve as guards through a mutual defensive agreement.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Gold dragons can eat almost anything, however, they usually sustain themselves on pearls or small gems. Gold dragons who receive pearls and gems from good or neutral creatures will usually be favorably inclined toward the gift bringers, as long as the gift is not presented as a crass bribe. In the latter case, the dragon will accept the gift, but react cynically to any requests the giver makes.</p>

					<p>Silver dragons are kind and helpful. They will cheerfully assist good creatures if their need is genuine. They often take the forms of kindly old men or fair damsels when associating with people.</p>
					<p>At birth, a silver dragon's scales are blue-gray with silver highlights. As the dragon approaches adulthood, its color slowly lightens to brightly gleaming silver. An <i>adult </i>or older silver dragon has scales so fine that the individual scales are scarcely visible. From a distance, these dragons look as if they have been sculpted from pure metal.</p>
					<p>Silver dragons speak their own tongue, a tongue common to all good dragons, and 16% of hatchling silver dragons have an ability to communicate with any intelligent creature. The chance to possess this ability increases 5% per age category of the dragon.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Silver dragons are not violent and avoid combat except when faced with highly evil or aggressive foes. If necessary, they use <i>feather fall </i>to stop any missiles fired at them. They use <i>wall of fog </i>or <i>control weather </i>to blind or confuse opponents before making melee attacks. If angry, they will use <i>reverse gravity </i>to fling enemies helplessly into the air, where they can be snatched. When faced with flying opponents, a silver dragon will hide in clouds (often creating some with <i>control weather </i>on clear days), remain there using <i>cloud walking </i>, then jump to the attack when they have the advantage.</p>
					<p>Breath Weapon/Special Abilities:</p>
					<p>A silver dragon has two breath weapons: a cone of cold 80' long, 5' wide at the dragon's mouth, and 30' wide at the end or a cloud of paralyzation gas 50' long, 40' wide, and 20' high. <b><u>Creatures caught in the cold are allowed a save versus breath weapon for half damage </u></b>. A silver dragon casts its spells and uses its magical abilities at 6th level, plus its combat modifier.</p>
					<p>At birth, silver dragons are <b><u>immune to cold and can </u></b><b><i><u>polymorph self </u></i></b><b><u>three times a day </u></b>. Each change in form lasts until the dragon chooses a different form and reverting to their normal form does not count as a change. They also can <i>cloud walk </i>. This allows the dragon to tread on clouds or fog as though they were solid ground. The ability functions continuously, but can be negated or resumed at will. As they age, they gain the following additional powers:</p>
					<p><i>Young: feather fall </i>twice a day. <i>Juvenile: wall of fog </i>once a day. <i>Adult: control winds </i>three times a day. <i>Mature adult: control weather </i>once a day. <i>Old: reverse gravity </i>once a day.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Silver dragons prefer aerial lairs on secluded mountain peaks, or amid the clouds themselves. When they lair in clouds there always will be an enchanted area with a sold floor for laying eggs and storing treasure.</p>
					<p>Silver dragons seem to prefer human form to their own, and often have mortal companions. Frequently they share deep friendships with mortals. Inevitably, however, the dragon reveals its true form and takes its leave to live a dragon's life for a time.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Silver dragons prefer human food, and can live on such fare indefinitely.</p>
					<p>Because they lair in similar territories, silver dragons come into conflict with red dragons. Duels between the two species are furious and deadly, but silver dragons generally get the upper hand since they are more capable of working together against their foes and often have human allies.</p>

					<p>Pseudodragons are a species of small flying lizard that inhabits heavily forested wilderness areas. These playful, benign creatures have magical powers that they can share with others, so they are often sought as companions.</p>
					<p>Pseudodragons resemble miniature red dragons. They have fine scales and sharp horns and teeth. A pseudodragon's coloration is red-brown as opposed to the deep red of red dragons. Its tail is about 2 feet long (longer than the pseudodragon itself), barbed, and very flexible.</p>
					<p>Pseudodragons communicate via a limited form of telepathy. If one elects to take a human companion, it can transmit what it sees and hears at a distance of up to 240 yards. Pseudodragons can vocalize animal noises such as a rasping purr (pleasure), a hiss (unpleasant surprise), a chirp (desire), or a growl (anger).</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>The pseudodragon can deliver a vicious bite with its small, dragonlike jaws, but its major weapon is its sting-equipped tail. The creature can move it with flashing speed and strikes at +4 on attack rolls. <b><u>Any creature struck must save vs. poison or go into a state of catalepsy that lasts 1-6 days </u></b>. The victim appears quite dead, but at the end of that time the character will either wake up unharmed (75% chance) or die (25% chance).</p>
					<p>Pseudodragons have a chameleonlike power that allows them to alter their coloration to blend with their surroundings. They can blend into any typical forest background with an 80% chance of being undetected by creatures which cannot see invisible objects. Pseudodragons have infravision with a 60 foot range and can see invisible objects.</p>
					<p>A pseudodragon is highly magic resistant and can transmit this magic resistance to its human companion via physical contact (a pseudodragon likes to be perched on the top of one's head or curled around the shoulders and upper back).</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>These forest-dwelling creatures place their lairs in the hollows of great trees or in large caves.</p>
					<p>A pseudodragon will very rarely take a human or demihuman as its companion. Some view these pseudodragons as the human's pet; the pseudodragon will be sure to correct this misunderstanding. There are two ways to become a pseudodragon's companion; one is to use magic to summon it (a <i>find familiar </i>spell). Another way is to find the pseudodragon on an adventure and pursuade it to become a companion.</p>
					<p>The pseudodragon that searches for companionship will stalk a candidate silently for days, reading his thoughts via telepathy, judging his deeds to be good or evil. If the candidate is found to be good, the pseudodragon will present itself to the human as a traveling companion and observe the human's reaction. If the human seems overjoyed and promises to take very good care of it, the pseudodragon will accept. If not, it will fly away.</p>
					<p>The personality of a pseudodragon has been described by some as catlike. A pseudodragon is willing to serve, provided that it is well-fed, groomed, and receives lots of attention. At times a pseudodragon seems arrogant, demanding, and less than willing to help. In order to gain its full cooperation, the companion must pamper the pseudodragon and make it feel as though it were the most important thing in his life. If the pseudodragon is mistreated or insulted it will leave, or worse, play pranks when least expected. Pseudodragons particularly dislike cruelty and will not serve cruel masters.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Pseudodragons are omnivorous but prefer to eat meat. Their diet consists chiefly of rodents and small birds with occasional leaves, fruits, and berries. In the wild, pseudodragons live solitary lives, protecting small personal hoards in their nests. They gather to mate once per year, in early spring, when gatherings of dozens of pseudodragons are not uncommon. After mating, males and females separate; females lay speckled brown eggs in clutches of four to six which hatch in mid-summer; females raise the young by themselves. Pseudodragons hibernate in winter; the young leave the nest in spring to mate.</p>
					<p>Pseudodragons have a lifespan of 10-15 years. Like dragons, they are attracted to bright shiny objects.</p>
					<p>Pseudodragon eggs can be resold for up to 10,000 gold pieces while a hatchling is worth as much as 20,000 gold pieces.</p>

					<p>Possessing some of the most dangerous qualities of a lion and a brass dragon, the dragonne is a vicious and deadly hunter, and a threat to many who travel in warmer climates.</p>
					<p>From a distance, a dragonne looks much like a giant lion, with the one very notable exception of the pair of small, brass-colored wings that stretch from the creature's shoulders. Upon closer inspection, other differences between the dragonne and its feline ancestor become apparent, too. The dragonne is covered with thick, brass-colored scales, much like a brass dragon, and its mane is much thicker and made of far coarser hair than a lion's. The beast also possesses huge claws and fangs, and large eyes, usually brass-colored like its scales. Dragonnes do not have their own language. Instead, they speak the languages of brass dragons and sphinxes.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Dragonnes usually attack first with their front claws, inflicting <b>1d8 points of damage </b>with each set, and their terrible jaws, inflicting <b>3d6 points of damage </b>. This is usually enough to slay most of the creatures the dragonne encounters. If a dragonne is in combat with an especially deadly opponent, or is wounded in a battle with a lesser opponent, however, it will use its deadly roar.</p>
					<p><b><u>A dragonne's roar causes </u></b><b><i><u>weakness </u></i></b><b><u>(due to fear) in all creatures within 120 feet of the monster, unless they roll successful saving throws vs. paralyzation </u></b>. Those creatures that save are not affected, but those that fail to save lose 50% of their Strength for 2d6 rounds. Worse still, any creature within 30 feet of the dragonne when it roars are deafened for 2d6 rounds. No save is possible against the deafening aspect of the dragonne's roar, and all affected creatures cannot hear any sound and fight with a -1 penalty to attack rolls (due to disorientation).</p>
					<p>The dragonne's roar is like a dragon's breath weapon in that it can only be used once every three rounds. <b><u>Creatures within the range of the dragonne's roar must roll saving throws vs. fear each time they hear it </u></b>. Once a creature is deafened, however, it cannot hear the dragonne's roar, and need not save against it, until the 2d6 rounds of temporary deafness are over.</p>
					<p>Although a dragonne's wings are useful only for short periods of time, carrying the creature for only 1-3 turns at a time, the dragonne uses its wings very effectively in battle. If any creatures attempt to charge the dragonne or encircle it, the dragonne simply takes to the air and finds a more defensible position. The dragonne prefers not to fight in the air, as it is very slow and maneuvers poorly compared to most flying creatures. It can fight with its claws and bite, and even its roar, when airborne, so it remains almost as deadly in the air as on the ground.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Dragonnes prefer to dwell in rocky foothills and deserts. They take large, natural caves for their lairs and store their small amounts of treasure, usually taken from slain adventurers, in loose piles around their rocky homes. Their territories are usually very large, as they generally inhabit desolate areas.</p>
					<p>They cannot bear the company of other dragonnes, and the creatures are found in pairs only during their brief mating season, late in the autumn. Dragonnes lay eggs, like their reptilian ancestors, and only one egg is produced a year by any dragonne. The female raises this young dragonne for one year, after which time even a mother and her young will be unfriendly if they meet. Male dragonnes are always antagonistic toward each other.</p>
					<p>In fact, dragonnes get along with very few creatures, and are considered a menace by most sentient races. More than anything, however, dragonnes wish to be left alone to hunt.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>The dragonne prefers herd animals like goats for food, especially since they don't fight back as fiercely as humans. It only attacks a human or demihuman for food if no other game is available. Dragonnes are not necessarily aggressive toward strangers, and the creature's reputation as a mindless devourer of helpless travelers is more the product of ignorance than well-researched fact. A dragonne will almost always attack any creature that invades its lair or threatens its territory. This means that adventurers who stumble across a dragonne's cave or settlers who decide to build in a dragonne's territory are often subject to fierce and immediate attack. Creatures not threatening the dragonne's lair or simply passing through its territory are usually left alone. Though the dragonne's intelligence is low, it can tell the difference between a harmless traveler and a potentially troublesome settler.</p>

					<p>Dryads are beautiful, intelligent tree sprites. They are as elusive as they are alluring, however, and dryads are rarely seen unless taken by surprise - or they wish to be spotted.</p>
					<p>The dryad's exquisite features, delicate and finely chiseled, are much like an elf maiden's. Dryads have high cheek bones and amber, violet, or dark green eyes. A dryad's complexion and hair color changes with the seasons, presenting the sprite with natural camouflage. During the fall, a dryad's hair turns golden or red, and her skin subtly darkens from its usual light tan to more closely match her hair color. This enables her to blend with the falling leaves of autumn. In winter, both the dryad's hair and skin are white, like the snows that cover the oak groves. When encountered in a forest during fall or winter, a dryad is often mistaken for an attractive maid, probably of elvish descent. No one would mistake a dryad for an elf maid during the spring and summer, however. At these times of year, a dryad's skin is lightly tanned and her hair is green like the oak leaves around her.</p>
					<p>Dryads often appear clothed in a loose, simple garment. The clothing they wear is the color of the oak grove in the season they appear. They speak their own tongue, as well as the languages of elves, pixies, and sprites. Dryads can also speak with plants.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Dryads are shy, nonviolent creatures. They rarely carry weapons, but they sometimes carry knives as tools. Though a dryad can use this as a weapon in a fight, she will not resort to using a knife unless seriously threatened.</p>
					<p>Dryads have the ability to throw a powerful <i>charm person </i>spell three times a day (but only once per round). This spell is so powerful that targets of the spell suffer a -3 penalty to their saving throws. A Dryad always uses this spell if seriously threatened, attempting to gain control of the attacker who could help her most against his comrades. Dryads will only attempt to charm elves as a last resort because of their natural resistance to this type of spell.</p>
					<p>The dryad's use of her ability to <i>charm </i>is not limited to combat situations, however. Whenever a dryad encounters a male with a Charisma of 16 or more, she usually tries to <i>charm </i>him. Charismatic victims of a dryad's attentions are taken to the tree sprite's home, where the men serve as amorous slaves to their beautiful captors. There is a 50% chance that a person <i>charmed </i>and taken away by a dryad will never return. If he does escape from the dryad's charms, it will be after 1d4 years of captivity.</p>
					<p>This tree sprite also has two other powers that are very useful in defense. Unless surprised, a dryad has the ability to literally step through a tree and then <i>dimension door </i>to the oak tree she is part of. She can also <i>speak with plants </i>(as the 4th-level priest spell). This enables the dryad to gather information about parties traveling near her tree, and even to use vegetation to hinder potential attackers.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Some legends claim that dryads are the animated souls of very old oak trees. Whether this is really the case, it is true that dryads are attached to a single, very large oak tree in their lifetimes and cannot, for any reason, go more than 360 yards from that tree. If a dryad does wander farther away, she becomes weak and dies within 6d6 hours unless returned to her home. The oak trees of dryads do not radiate magic, but someone finding a dryad's home has great power over her. A dryad suffers damage for any damage inflicted upon her home tree. Any attack on a dryad's tree will, of course, bring on a frenzied defense by the dryad.</p>
					<p>Although dryads are generally very solitary, up to six have been encountered in one place. This is rare, however. All this really means is that a number of dryad oaks are within 100 yards of one another and the dryads' paths cross. These dryads may come to each other's aid, but never really gather socially. Any treasure owned by a tree sprite is hidden close to her home tree. The gold and gems that make up a dryad's treasure are almost always the gifts of charmed adventurers.</p>
					<p>These tree sprites realize that most humans and demihumans fear them for their ability to <i>charm </i>, so dryads only deal with strangers on rare occasions. When approached carefully, however, dryads have been known to aid adventurers. They are a useful source of information, too, as they know a great deal about the area in which they live.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Dryads are staunch protectors of the forest and groves in which they reside. Any actions that harm the area, and especially its plant life, are met with little tolerance.</p>

					<p>Derro are a degenerate race of dwarven stature. They have dwelled in the Underdark for ages, but they were discovered by the mind flayers only five centuries ago, and by the drow but shortly before that. The derro have made a name for themselves by their marked cruelty. It is said that a derro lives for two things: the slow and humiliating death of surface demihumans and especially humans, and the perversion of knowledge for their own dark ends.</p>
					<p>Derro are short, with skin the color of an ice-covered lake (white, with bluish undertones), sickly pale yellow or tan hair (always straight), and staring, pupil-less eyes. Their features remind dwarves of humans, and vice versa. Derro have rough skin, spotted with short coarse tufts of hair. Most derro wear a loose costume woven from the hair of underground creatures and dyed in deep reds and browns. Even in full armor, exploring new territory or patrolling their own, derro are easily recognizable. Their armor is leather, studded in copper and brass. Leaders, though, wear tougher leather armors, made from the hides of creatures far tougher than cattle. Derro prefer weapons designed to cripple opponents, rather than those built for a quick kill: derro don't see any sport in spears and axes.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Derro are one of the most dexterous of humanoid races (averaging 15-18) and their Armor Class must be adjusted for this. Normally, a derro party is well-equipped with weapons and spells. All derro carry small, ornamental blades, called secari, which can be treated as daggers, but most use other weapons as well.</p>
					<p>Half of encountered derro carry a repeating light crossbow (12 maximum range, two shots each round, six-bolt capacity, <b>1d3 points of damage </b>). Virtually every derro crossbowman coats his bolts with poison. If a derro wants to simply bring down his prey, he uses a poison that causes an additional <b>2d6 points of damage </b>(successful saving throw for no additional damage). If a derro wishes to prolong his target's suffering, he uses a poison that has the same effects as the ray of enfeeblement spell (again, a successful saving throw indicates no poison damage).</p>
					<p>Twenty-five percent of derro carry a hook-fauchard, a long (6'+) pole arm that causes 1d4 points of impaling damage and can pull a man-sized or smaller creature off-balance 25% of the time. An off-balance character must spend the next round regaining his balance.</p>
					<p>Fifteen percent of derro use only a spiked buckler (a small shield, improving the creature's AC by 1 against any one opponent, armed with a central spike, which can be wielded as a second weapon with no penalty [because of the derro's high Dexterity] for 1d4 points of impaling damage) and a hooked aklys. The aklys is a short, heavy club that can be thrown for 1d6 points of crushing damage. It is attached to a thick, leather thong so that it might be retrieved. Thanks to the hook, the aklys also pulls an opponent off-balance, as the hook-fauchard above, though it has only a one-in-eight chance. These derro are considered brave by their fellows: they are awarded the rarer, heavier armors (AC 4).</p>
					<p>The remaining 10% of derro encountered are the sons and daughters of derro leaders. They are given heavier armor as well,and are trained in the use of spear and military pick. They alsouse bucklers (without spikes) when they are not using the spear two-handed.For every three derro encountered, there is one additional derro with 4 Hit Dice. For every six derro, there is one with 5 Hit Dice. If ten or more are encountered, there is always an additional 7-Hit Die leader with a 6-Hit Die lieutenant. (So if a party encountered 25 derro, these would be accompanied by eight 4-Hit Die derro, four 5-Hit Die derro, one derro with 6 Hit Dice, and one with 7.) These leader types always wear the thicker armor and usually wield well-made (occasionally magical) weapons.</p>
					<p>If 20 or more derro are encountered, they are accompanied by a savant and two student savants. Savant derro are sage-like, able to use any sort of magical item and weapon. Savants know 1d4+5 of the following spells, learned at random: <i>affect normal fires </i>, <i>anti-magic shell </i>, <i>blink </i>, <i>cloudkill </i>, <i>ESP </i>, <i>hypnotic pattern </i>, <i>ice storm </i>, <i>invisibility </i>, <i>levitate </i>, <i>light </i>, <i>lightning bolt </i>, <i>minor creation </i>, <i>paralyzation </i>, <i>repulsion </i>, <i>shadow magic </i>, <i>spider climb </i>, <i>ventriloquism </i>, <i>wall of fog </i>, <i>wall of force </i>. Savants have 5-8 Hit Dice, and carry two or three useful magical items. Typical magical items are any potion, any scroll, <i>rings of fire resistance </i>, <i>invisibility </i>, <i>protection </i>, and <i>spell storing </i>, any wand, <i>studded leather armor +1 </i>, shields, weapons up to +3, <i>bracers of defense </i>, <i>brooches of shielding </i>, <i>cloaks of protection </i>, and so on. Savants can instinctively <i>comprehend languages </i>and <i>read magic </i>(as the spells).</p>
					<p>Savants are also capable of acting as sages in one to three areas of study. Derro raiding parties' missions are often inspired by a savant's research.</p>
					<p>Student savants know only 1-3 spells, have 4-7 Hit Dice, know only one field of study, and typically have one minor magical item. They are otherwise identical to their savant teachers.</p>
					<p>In combat, derro fight with cunning and good tactics. Their goals are to separate an enemy from his weapons (perhaps by snagging a weapon with a hook-fauchard [on an attack roll to hit AC 6] and then pressing the battle, keeping the unfortunate opponent away from his dropped weapon), keep spellcasters from effectively using magic, and inflict minor wounds until they eventually kill their opponents. Savants use their powers to confuse and frustrate, rather than to simply kill. For instance, a <i>lightning bolt </i>spell would be used to seal off an escape route, but well ahead of the party of humans fleeing down it. Derro have poor infravision (30-foot range) but keen hearing (treat as the blind-fighting nonweapon proficiency).</p>
					<p>Derro keep slaves and attempt to capture intelligent opponents, if possible.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Derro dwell in large underground complexes, nearer the surface than the kuo-toa and drow, but deeper than goblins and trolls. They never expose themselves to direct sunlight, as it nauseates them. Sunlight would kill a derro were he to be exposed to it for a few days. Yet derro occasionally visit the surface world at night, raiding for humans or carrying out a savant's plans.</p>
					<p>Derro are never encountered singly. From their combat tactics to their choice of spells, derro demonstrate a mob mentality. A lone demo (the last survivor of an ill-fated patrol, perhaps) is a desperate derro, seeking at all costs to return to his home lair.</p>
					<p>A derro lair always has 3d4 + 30 normal derro, plus leaders. The members of the lair are led by the resident savants (1-3 in number) and their apprentices (2-5 student savants). Derro unquestioningly obey the puzzling, even suicidal, dictates from their savant leaders.</p>
					<p>Should a lair grow very much over 40 inhabitants, half the group (with half the savants and half the leaders) will split off and form an independent community. Such a splinter group will travel quite a distance before settling down, as no two derro lairs have been spotted within several miles of each other. The two groups may communicate for a short time, in order to ensure the new lair's safety, but they soon sever all contacts and act utterly independently of one another. Although it is possible for two lairs to be at war with one another, or to join in combat against a common enemy, no examples of these behaviors have ever been recorded, with the exception of the regular Uniting War, described below.</p>
					<p>Also to be found in a derro lair are 5d6+10 human slaves. If any of the lair's savants or students know the charm person spell, each slave has a 90% chance of being charmed. Derro hate humans more than any other race; they use humans for the most demeaning manual labor and for breeding.</p>
					<p>The derro are said to have a major stronghold somewhere in the Underdark, and there the savants plot and scheme to devastate the surface world and enslave all humanity.</p>
					<p>Derro do not appear to worship any powers, but the savants treasure knowledge and the rest of the race pretty much worships the savants. The worst criminals in the derro community, subject to the Polite Execution (which takes a good two weeks, and which roams over miles of subterranean territory), are those who do not follow the laws of the savants.</p>
					<p>Most of those laws have to do with the derros' goals: the destruction of humanity and the acquisition of arcane and obscure information. Derro usually scour their territory for magical items, stealing them or, if necessary, purchasing them from more powerful creatures. Derro do not share the love of gold common to their dwarfish relatives, and they have been known to pay exorbitant prices for a few potions or for a magical item with a missing command word.</p>
					<p>This serves as one of the bases of trade between derro and other races of the Underdark. Drow find derro to be dangerous opponents (due to the latter's magic resistance) and a race of barbarians with too much interest in the surface world. The mind flayers think the derro taste bad. Duergar disapprove of the derro's love of cruelty. And derro really don't much care about the other races deep beneath the surface. But derro often raid the surface and acquire technology or items that other deep races desire, and so limited trade between a lair and some surrounding creatures is possible.</p>
					<p>Every 20 years or so, the derro race mounts an all-out war against other creatures of the Underdark. This is known as the Uniting War, and no savant really expects to win it. The War is a means of winnowing out the weakest of the derro lairs, a focal point for racial identity, and a chance to really start some terror throughout the Underdark. It also serves the purpose of starting rumors. That is, humans will certainly hear that a war is being fought in the Underdark, and will send hundreds of scouting and adventuring parties into the deep underground to investigate. The derro welcome this new source of slaves.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Derro can live on a diet of underground fungi, but they find the stuff to be foul-tasting if used as anything other than spices. Thus they seek out other sustenance whenever possible. A derro hunting party usually pursues large, dangerous prey that can feed the entire lair, rather than smaller, simpler food. The derro tendency to torment prey holds true with hunting for food.</p>
					<p>The derro also raid other races for food. Sometimes, they merely rob the dwarves or the orcs, hoping to provoke an amusing conflict. But such excursions are tame compared to Open Hunting, the derro term for midnight raids into human settlements. When Open Hunting, a derro party steals cattle and swine, to let loose and hunt at a later time, but it primarily kidnaps humans. As mentioned before, derro treasure humans for slaves and for breeding.</p>
					<p>Derro have few other roles in the underground ecosystem. In the last few Uniting Wars, the drow noticed that derro blood (a milky substance that turns brown and rotten upon the slightest exposure to bright light) was a useful ingredient in drow potions.</p>

					<p>Dwarves are a noble race of demihumans who dwell under the earth, forging great cities and waging massive wars against the forces of chaos and evil. Dwarves also have much in common with the rocks and gems they love to work, for they are both hard and unyielding. It's often been said that it's easier to make a stone weep than it is to change a dwarf's mind.</p>
					<p>Standing from four to 41/2 feet in height, and weighing 130 to 170 pounds, dwarves tend to be stocky and muscular. They have ruddy cheeks and bright eyes. Their skin is typically deep tan or light brown. Their hair is usually black, gray, or brown, and worn long, though not long enough to impair vision in any way. They favor long beards and mustaches, too. Dwarves value their beards highly and tend to groom them very carefully. Dwarves do not favor ornate stylings or wrappings for their hair or their beards.</p>
					<p>Dwarven clothing tends to be simple and functional. They often wear earth tones, and their cloth is considered rough by many other races, especially men and elves. Dwarves usually wear one or more pieces of jewelry, though these items are usually not of any great value or very ostentatious. Though dwarves value gems and precious metals, they consider it in bad taste to flaunt wealth.</p>
					<p>Because dwarves are a sturdy race, they add 1 to their initial Constitution ability scores. However, because they are a solitary people, tending toward distrust of outsiders and other races, they subtract 1 from their initial Charisma ability scores. Dwarves usually live from 350 to 450 years.</p>
					<p>Dwarves have found it useful to learn the languages of many of their allies and enemies. In addition to their own languages, dwarves often speak the languages of gnomes, goblins, kobolds, orcs, and the common tongue, which is frequently used in trade negotiations with other races.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Dwarves are courageous, tenacious fighters who are ill-disposed toward magic. They never use magical spells or train as wizards, though they can become priests and use the spells of this group. Because of their nonmagical nature, in fact, they get a special bonus to all saving throws against magical wands, staves, rods, and spells. Dwarves receive a +1 bonus to saving throws against these magical attacks for every 31/2 points of Constitution score they have. See Table 9 in the <i>Player's Handbook </i>for specific bonuses.</p>
					<p>A dwarf's nonmagical nature can also cause problems when he tries to use a magical item. In fact, if a dwarf uses a magical item that is not specifically created for his class, there is a 20% chance the item malfunctions. For example, if a dwarven fighter uses a bag of holding - which can be used by any class, not just fighters - there is a 20% chance each time the dwarf uses it that the bag does not work properly. This chance of malfunction applies to rods, staves, wands, rings, amulets, potions, horns, jewels, and miscellaneous magic. However, dwarves have learned to master certain types of magical items - because of an item's military nature. These objects - specifically weapons, shields, armor, gauntlets, and girdles - are not subject to magical malfunction when used by a dwarf of any class.</p>
					<p>As with magical attacks, dwarves are unusually <b><u>resistant to toxic substances </u></b>. Because of their exceptionally strong Constitution, all dwarves roll saving throws against poisons with the same bonus (+1 for every 31/2 points of Constitution score) that applies to saves vs. magical attacks.</p>
					<p>In the thousands of years that dwarves have lived in the earth, they have developed a number of skills and special abilities that help them to survive. All dwarves have infravision that enables them to see up to 60 feet in the dark. When underground, dwarves can tell quite a bit about their location by looking carefully at their surroundings. When within 10 feet of what they are looking for, dwarves can detect the grade and slope of a passage (1-5 on 1d6), new tunnel construction (1-5 on 1d6), sliding/shifting walls or rooms (1-4 on 1d6), and stonework traps, pits, and deadfalls (1-3 on 1d6). Dwarves can also determine their approximate depth underground (1-3 on 1d6) at any time.</p>
					<p>During their time under the earth, dwarves have also developed an intense hatred of many of the evil creatures they commonly encounter. Thus, in melee, dwarves always add 1 to their attack rolls to hit orcs, half-orcs, goblins, and hobgoblins. The small size of dwarves is an advantage against ogres, trolls, ogre magi, giants, and titans; these monsters always subtract 4 from their attack rolls against dwarves because of that size difference and the dwarves' training in fighting such large foes.</p>
					<p>Dwarven armies are well-organized and extremely well-disciplined. Dwarven troops usually wear chain mail and carry shields in battle. They wield a variety of weapons. The composition of a typical dwarven army by weaponry is axe and hammer (25%), sword and spear (20%), sword and light crossbow (15%), sword and pole arm (10%), axe and heavy crossbow (10%), axe and mace (10%), or hammer and pick (10%).</p>
					<p>For every 40 dwarves encountered, there is a 2nd- to 6th-level fighter who leads the group. (Roll 1d6 to determine level, with a roll of 1 equalling 2.) If there are 160 or more dwarves encountered, there are, in addition to the leaders of the smaller groups, one 6th-level fighter (a chief) and a 4th-level fighter (lieutenant) commanding the troops. If 200 or more dwarves are encountered, there is a fighter/priest of 3rd- to 6th-level fighting ability and 4th-to 7th-level priest ability. If a dwarven army has 320 or more troops in it, the following high-level leaders are in command of the group: an 8th-level fighter, a 7th-level fighter, a 6th-level fighter/7th-level priest, and two 4th-level fighter/priests.</p>
					<p>The commanders of the dwarven troops wear plate armor and carry shields. In addition, the fighters and fighter/priests leading the dwarven troops have a 10% chance per level of fighting ability of having magical armor and/or weapons. The fighter/priests who lead the troops also have a 10% chance per level of priest ability of having a magical item specific to priests (and thus not subject to malfunction).</p>
					<p>If encountered in its home, a dwarven army has, in addition to the leaders noted above, 2d6 fighters of from 2nd- to 5th-level (1d4+1 for level), 2d4 fighter/priests of from 2nd- to 4th-level (in each class), females equal to 50% of the adult males, and children equal to 25% of the adult males. Dwarven women are skilled in combat and fight as males if their homes are attacked.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Usually constructed around profitable mines, dwarven cities are vast, beautiful complexes carved into solid stone. Dwarven cities take hundreds of years to complete, but once finished they stand for millennia without needing any type of repair. Since dwarves do not leave their homes often and always return to them, they create their cities with permanence in mind. Troops guard dwarven cities at all times, and sometimes (60% chance) dwarves also use animals as guards - either 2d4 brown bears (75% chance) or 5d4 wolves (25% chance).</p>
					<p>Dwarven society is organized into clans. A dwarven clan not already attached to a city or mine travels until it finds an outpost where it can begin to ply a trade. Clans often settle close together since they usually need the same raw materials for their crafts. Clans are competitive, but usually do not war against one another. Dwarven cities are founded when enough clans move to a particular location.</p>
					<p>Each dwarven clan usually specializes in a particular craft or skill; young dwarves are apprenticed at an early age to a master in their clan (or, occasionally, in another clan) to learn a trade. Since dwarves live so long, apprenticeships last for many years. Dwarves also consider political and military service a skilled trade, so soldiers and politicians are usually subjected to a long period of apprenticeship before they are considered professionals.</p>
					<p>To folk from other races, life within these cities might seem as rigid and unchanging as the stone that the dwarven houses are wrought from. In fact, it is. Above all, dwarves value law and order. This love of stability probably comes from the dwarves' long life spans, for dwarves can watch things made of wood and other mutable materials decay within a single lifetime. It shouldn't be surprising, then, that they value things that are unchanging and toil ceaselessly to make their crafts beautiful and long-lived. For a dwarf, the earth is something to be loved because of its stability and the sea a thing to be despised - and feared - because it is a symbol of change.</p>
					<p>Dwarves also prize wealth, as it is something that can be developed over a long period of time. All types of precious metal, but particularly gold, are highly prized by dwarves, as are diamonds and other gems. They do not value pearls, however, as they are reminders of the sea and all it stands for. Dwarves believe, however, that it is in poor taste to advertise wealth. Metals and gems are best counted in secret, so that neighbors are not offended or tempted.</p>
					<p>Most other races see dwarves as a greedy, dour, grumpy folk who prefer the dampness of a cave to the brightness of an open glade. This is partially true. Dwarves have little patience for men and other short-lived races (since man's concerns seem so petty when seen from dwarven eyes). Dwarves also mistrust elves because they are not as serious-minded as dwarves and waste their long lives on pastimes the dwarves see as frivolous. However, dwarves have been known to band together with both men and elves in times of crisis, and long-term trade agreements and alliances are common.</p>
					<p>Dwarves have no mixed feelings about the evil races that dwell below ground and in the Underdark, however. They have an intense hatred of orcs, goblins, evil giants, and drow. The dire creatures of the Underdark often fear dwarves, too, for the short, stout folk are tireless enemies of evil and chaos. It is a goal of the dwarves to wage constant and bitter war against their enemies under the earth until either they or their foes are destroyed.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Since much of their culture is focused on creating things from the earth, dwarves produce a large amount of useful, valuable trade material. Dwarves are skilled miners. Though they rarely sell the precious metals and rough gems they uncover, dwarven miners have been known to sell surpluses to local human communities. Dwarves are also skilled engineers and master builders - though they work almost exclusively with stone - and some dwarven architects work for humans quite frequently.</p>
					<p>Dwarves most often trade in finished goods. Many clans are dedicated to work as blacksmiths, silversmiths, goldsmiths, armorers, weapons makers, and gem cutters. Dwarven products are highly valued for their workmanship. In human communities, these goods often demand prices up to 20% higher than locally forged items. Many people are still willing to pay a high price for a suit of dwarven mail or a dwarven sword. Humans know that the dwarf who forged the item made it to last a dwarven lifetime, so they'll never need to worry about it wearing out in theirs.</p>
					<p><b>Mountain Dwarves</b></p>
					<p>Similar in most ways to their cousins, the hill dwarves, these demihumans prefer to live deep inside mountains. They tend to be slightly taller than hill dwarves (averaging 41/2 feet tall) and more hearty (having 1+1 Hit Dice). They usually have slightly lighter skin and hair than their hill-dwelling relatives. In battle, mountain dwarf armies are likely to have more spears (30% maximum) and fewer crossbows (20% maximum) than hill dwarf armies. Mountain dwarves have the same interests and biases as hill dwarves, though they are even more isolationist than their cousins and sometimes consider even hill dwarves to be outsiders. Mountain dwarves live for at least 400 years.</p>

For example, if a dwarven fighter uses a bag of holding - which can be used by any class, not just fighters - there is a 20% chance each time the dwarf uses it that the bag does not work properly. This chance of malfunction applies to rods, staves, wands, rings, amulets, potions, horns, jewels, and miscellaneous magic. However, dwarves have learned to master certain types of magical items - because of an item's military nature. These objects - specifically weapons, shields, armor, gauntlets, and girdles - are not subject to magical malfunction when used by a dwarf of any class.</p>
					<p>As with magical attacks, dwarves are unusually <b><u>resistant to toxic substances </u></b>. Because of their exceptionally strong Constitution, all dwarves roll saving throws against poisons with the same bonus (+1 for every 31/2 points of Constitution score) that applies to saves vs. magical attacks.</p>
					<p>In the thousands of years that dwarves have lived in the earth, they have developed a number of skills and special abilities that help them to survive. All dwarves have infravision that enables them to see up to 60 feet in the dark. When underground, dwarves can tell quite a bit about their location by looking carefully at their surroundings. When within 10 feet of what they are looking for, dwarves can detect the grade and slope of a passage (1-5 on 1d6), new tunnel construction (1-5 on 1d6), sliding/shifting walls or rooms (1-4 on 1d6), and stonework traps, pits, and deadfalls (1-3 on 1d6). Dwarves can also determine their approximate depth underground (1-3 on 1d6) at any time.</p>
					<p>During their time under the earth, dwarves have also developed an intense hatred of many of the evil creatures they commonly encounter. Thus, in melee, dwarves always add 1 to their attack rolls to hit orcs, half-orcs, goblins, and hobgoblins. The small size of dwarves is an advantage against ogres, trolls, ogre magi, giants, and titans; these monsters always subtract 4 from their attack rolls against dwarves because of that size difference and the dwarves' training in fighting such large foes.</p>
					<p>Dwarven armies are well-organized and extremely well-disciplined. Dwarven troops usually wear chain mail and carry shields in battle. They wield a variety of weapons. The composition of a typical dwarven army by weaponry is axe and hammer (25%), sword and spear (20%), sword and light crossbow (15%), sword and pole arm (10%), axe and heavy crossbow (10%), axe and mace (10%), or hammer and pick (10%).</p>
					<p>For every 40 dwarves encountered, there is a 2nd- to 6th-level fighter who leads the group. (Roll 1d6 to determine level, with a roll of 1 equalling 2.) If there are 160 or more dwarves encountered, there are, in addition to the leaders of the smaller groups, one 6th-level fighter (a chief) and a 4th-level fighter (lieutenant) commanding the troops. If 200 or more dwarves are encountered, there is a fighter/priest of 3rd- to 6th-level fighting ability and 4th-to 7th-level priest ability. If a dwarven army has 320 or more troops in it, the following high-level leaders are in command of the group: an 8th-level fighter, a 7th-level fighter, a 6th-level fighter/7th-level priest, and two 4th-level fighter/priests.</p>
					<p>The commanders of the dwarven troops wear plate armor and carry shields. In addition, the fighters and fighter/priests leading the dwarven troops have a 10% chance per level of fighting ability of having magical armor and/or weapons. The fighter/priests who lead the troops also have a 10% chance per level of priest ability of having a magical item specific to priests (and thus not subject to malfunction).</p>
					<p>If encountered in its home, a dwarven army has, in addition to the leaders noted above, 2d6 fighters of from 2nd- to 5th-level (1d4+1 for level), 2d4 fighter/priests of from 2nd- to 4th-level (in each class), females equal to 50% of the adult males, and children equal to 25% of the adult males. Dwarven women are skilled in combat and fight as males if their homes are attacked.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Usually constructed around profitable mines, dwarven cities are vast, beautiful complexes carved into solid stone. Dwarven cities take hundreds of years to complete, but once finished they stand for millennia without needing any type of repair. Since dwarves do not leave their homes often and always return to them, they create their cities with permanence in mind. Troops guard dwarven cities at all times, and sometimes (60% chance) dwarves also use animals as guards - either 2d4 brown bears (75% chance) or 5d4 wolves (25% chance).</p>
					<p>Dwarven society is organized into clans. A dwarven clan not already attached to a city or mine travels until it finds an outpost where it can begin to ply a trade. Clans often settle close together since they usually need the same raw materials for their crafts. Clans are competitive, but usually do not war against one another. Dwarven cities are founded when enough clans move to a particular location.</p>
					<p>Each dwarven clan usually specializes in a particular craft or skill; young dwarves are apprenticed at an early age to a master in their clan (or, occasionally, in another clan) to learn a trade. Since dwarves live so long, apprenticeships last for many years. Dwarves also consider political and military service a skilled trade, so soldiers and politicians are usually subjected to a long period of apprenticeship before they are considered professionals.</p>
					<p>To folk from other races, life within these cities might seem as rigid and unchanging as the stone that the dwarven houses are wrought from. In fact, it is. Above all, dwarves value law and order. This love of stability probably comes from the dwarves' long life spans, for dwarves can watch things made of wood and other mutable materials decay within a single lifetime. It shouldn't be surprising, then, that they value things that are unchanging and toil ceaselessly to make their crafts beautiful and long-lived. For a dwarf, the earth is something to be loved because of its stability and the sea a thing to be despised - and feared - because it is a symbol of change.</p>
					<p>Dwarves also prize wealth, as it is something that can be developed over a long period of time. All types of precious metal, but particularly gold, are highly prized by dwarves, as are diamonds and other gems. They do not value pearls, however, as they are reminders of the sea and all it stands for. Dwarves believe, however, that it is in poor taste to advertise wealth. Metals and gems are best counted in secret, so that neighbors are not offended or tempted.</p>
					<p>Most other races see dwarves as a greedy, dour, grumpy folk who prefer the dampness of a cave to the brightness of an open glade. This is partially true. Dwarves have little patience for men and other short-lived races (since man's concerns seem so petty when seen from dwarven eyes). Dwarves also mistrust elves because they are not as serious-minded as dwarves and waste their long lives on pastimes the dwarves see as frivolous. However, dwarves have been known to band together with both men and elves in times of crisis, and long-term trade agreements and alliances are common.</p>
					<p>Dwarves have no mixed feelings about the evil races that dwell below ground and in the Underdark, however. They have an intense hatred of orcs, goblins, evil giants, and drow. The dire creatures of the Underdark often fear dwarves, too, for the short, stout folk are tireless enemies of evil and chaos. It is a goal of the dwarves to wage constant and bitter war against their enemies under the earth until either they or their foes are destroyed.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Since much of their culture is focused on creating things from the earth, dwarves produce a large amount of useful, valuable trade material. Dwarves are skilled miners. Though they rarely sell the precious metals and rough gems they uncover, dwarven miners have been known to sell surpluses to local human communities. Dwarves are also skilled engineers and master builders - though they work almost exclusively with stone - and some dwarven architects work for humans quite frequently.</p>
					<p>Dwarves most often trade in finished goods. Many clans are dedicated to work as blacksmiths, silversmiths, goldsmiths, armorers, weapons makers, and gem cutters. Dwarven products are highly valued for their workmanship. In human communities, these goods often demand prices up to 20% higher than locally forged items. Many people are still willing to pay a high price for a suit of dwarven mail or a dwarven sword. Humans know that the dwarf who forged the item made it to last a dwarven lifetime, so they'll never need to worry about it wearing out in theirs.</p>
					<p><b>Mountain Dwarves</b></p>
					<p>Similar in most ways to their cousins, the hill dwarves, these demihumans prefer to live deep inside mountains. They tend to be slightly taller than hill dwarves (averaging 41/2 feet tall) and more hearty (having 1+1 Hit Dice). They usually have slightly lighter skin and hair than their hill-dwelling relatives. In battle, mountain dwarf armies are likely to have more spears (30% maximum) and fewer crossbows (20% maximum) than hill dwarf armies. Mountain dwarves have the same interests and biases as hill dwarves, though they are even more isolationist than their cousins and sometimes consider even hill dwarves to be outsiders. Mountain dwarves live for at least 400 years.</p>

					<p>Eagles are majestic birds of prey, rarely used for hunting, but often sought after for their beauty and legendary courage.</p>
					<p>Eagles are large birds, usually standing around three feet tall. with distinctive feathering on their legs. Their wing span is an impressive six to seven feet. Eagles are usually brown in color, ranging from the blackish brown of the golden eagle to the dark brown of the bald eagle. They always sport a set of razor-sharp talons and a beak, equally as sharp and turned down abruptly at its point. The eagle's cry is high and shrill.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>An eagle uses its claws and beak for combat, each of which inflicts <b>1-2 points of damage </b>. An eagle typically attacks from great heights, folding back its wings and letting gravity hurtle it toward its prey. If an eagle dives for more than 100', its diving speed is double its normal flying speed and the eagle is restricted to attacking with only its two sets of claws. However, these high-speed attacks gain a +2 bonus to the attack roll and score double damage.</p>
					<p>Eagles also have exceptional eyesight. This superior vision affords eagles the advantage of rarely being surprised. During the day, an eagle can be surprised only 5% of the time. At night, normal rules for surprise apply.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>High rocky cliffs and tall, broad trees are the favorite nesting spots for eagles. Once an eagle builds a nest, it will keep that home, adding it with each passing season, until the nest is destroyed or the eagle dies. There is always a 50% chance that 1d4 eggs are present in a nest. If eggs are not present, there is a 20% chance that 1d4 young eagles are present instead. There is always a 10% chance that the eagle is storing some small, shiny objects in the nest (like gold coins or gems).</p>
					<p>Eagles are usually encountered alone or in pairs. Eagles mate for life and, since they nest in one spot each year, it is easy to identify places where eagles are normally present. On occasion, in an area of especially rich feeding, 1d8+4 eagles are encountered instead of the normal individual or pair. This fertile area can support more than one nest, so more eagles move into the area. This occurs only 5% of the time, however.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Eagles are carnivores and generally hunt rodents, fish, and other small animals. Eagles have also been known to feed on the carrion of recently killed creatures, as well. Unless exceptionally hungry, an eagle will never attack a human or demihuman, though small creatures like brownies have to be wary of a hunting eagle mistaking them for rabbits.</p>
					<p>Eagles are not easy to train for hunting purposes (only 25% chance of success). Nevertheless, a thriving market for eaglets and eagle eggs means that each one captured brings a price of 60 to 100 gp. Eagle feathers and other eagle tokens are also valued highly by many adventurers, as they wrongly believe the eagle's courage to be transferred to them by possession of such items.</p>
					<p><b>Eagle, Giant</b></p>
					<p>Giant eagles usually stand 10 feet tall and have wing spans of up to 20'. They share the coloration and fighting methods of their smaller cousins, inflicting much more damage, of course. However, if a giant eagle dives more than 50', it adds +4 to its attack roll and doubles its normal claw attack damage of 1d6/1d6. Giant eagles have their own language, but they also communicate through a form of limited telepathy. Giant eagles also have exceptional eyesight and cannot be surprised except at night or in their lair, and then only 10% of the time.</p>
					<p>Giant eagles build their nests only in high mountain passes, where they have room to fly undisturbed. They are far more social than wild eagles, and up to 20 have been discovered nesting in the same area. One nest will be found for each pair of giant eagles. There is a 50% chance that 1d4 eggs are present in a nest, or a 25% chance of 1d4 young. If there are young or eggs in the nest, the giant eagle will attack any creature within 50' of the nest. Eagles are always suspicious of any creature coming near a nest, whether eaglets are present or not, as this is where their treasure is to be found.</p>
					<p>Some individual dwarves and elves - and sometims even groups of dwarves and elves - are considered friends by giant eagles. Members of the two races are considered less of a threat than humans. Giant eagles can be trained, and their eggs sell for 500 to 800 gp each on the open market.</p>

This fertile area can support more than one nest, so more eagles move into the area. This occurs only 5% of the time, however.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Eagles are carnivores and generally hunt rodents, fish, and other small animals. Eagles have also been known to feed on the carrion of recently killed creatures, as well. Unless exceptionally hungry, an eagle will never attack a human or demihuman, though small creatures like brownies have to be wary of a hunting eagle mistaking them for rabbits.</p>
					<p>Eagles are not easy to train for hunting purposes (only 25% chance of success). Nevertheless, a thriving market for eaglets and eagle eggs means that each one captured brings a price of 60 to 100 gp. Eagle feathers and other eagle tokens are also valued highly by many adventurers, as they wrongly believe the eagle's courage to be transferred to them by possession of such items.</p>
					<p><b>Eagle, Giant</b></p>
					<p>Giant eagles usually stand 10 feet tall and have wing spans of up to 20'. They share the coloration and fighting methods of their smaller cousins, inflicting much more damage, of course. However, if a giant eagle dives more than 50', it adds +4 to its attack roll and doubles its normal claw attack damage of 1d6/1d6. Giant eagles have their own language, but they also communicate through a form of limited telepathy. Giant eagles also have exceptional eyesight and cannot be surprised except at night or in their lair, and then only 10% of the time.</p>
					<p>Giant eagles build their nests only in high mountain passes, where they have room to fly undisturbed. They are far more social than wild eagles, and up to 20 have been discovered nesting in the same area. One nest will be found for each pair of giant eagles. There is a 50% chance that 1d4 eggs are present in a nest, or a 25% chance of 1d4 young. If there are young or eggs in the nest, the giant eagle will attack any creature within 50' of the nest. Eagles are always suspicious of any creature coming near a nest, whether eaglets are present or not, as this is where their treasure is to be found.</p>
					<p>Some individual dwarves and elves - and sometims even groups of dwarves and elves - are considered friends by giant eagles. Members of the two races are considered less of a threat than humans. Giant eagles can be trained, and their eggs sell for 500 to 800 gp each on the open market.</p>

					<p>The snowy, sandy wastes of Pelion are home to the bralani eladrins. They're the wildest and most feral of their kind, existing from heartbeat to heartbeat in a glorious, never-ending passion. No eladrin can match the fury of an angry bralani, or the keening depths of her grief or sorrow, or the blissful heights of her joy. Bralani are tied to the plains of Pelion, but may occasionally be found dancing in the desert winds or arctic wastes of other realms, exulting in their freedom and the beauty of the open land.</p>
					<p>Bralani in their natural form resemble short, stocky elves, broad in the shoulders but graceful nonetheless. Their hair is usually a bright silvery-white, and their eyes are an everchanging rainbow of hues that flicker and shift with the vagaries of the bralani's mood. Bralani can also take the shape of a whirlwind of dust, sand, or snow, racing across their beloved plains like living zephyrs.</p>
					<p>Bralani are the most distant and fey of the eladrins, dangerous to approach and fickle in temperament. Strangers might be greeted with wild celebration or attacked in a towering rage. Although the bralani's purpose seems to be to dance and race about in the wastes, they'll drop their endless dance in a moment if they come across evil in their domain. A few rare and unusual bralani sojourning in other worlds ally themselves with the local forces of good, siding with a tribe of noble desert savages or aiding a group of northern herdsmen.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>In humanoid form, bralani are surprisingly strong; they've got an 18/76 Strength with the resulting bonuses. Balani prefer the spear, the bow, and the scimitar - weapons of the desert nomads they most closely resemble. Bralani weapons're often enchanted. These folk are superb archers, and gain a +4 bonus to bow attacks due to their great Dexterity and instinctive mastery of the wind.</p>
					<p>However, a bralani's just as likely to abandon his weapons and attack as a living whirlwind. In this form, he's AC -2 and can attack with two scourging sand- or snow-blasts for <b>1d10 points of damage </b>each. The blasts have a 20-foot range and affect a cone 5' in diameter. <b><u>Any creature within 20 feet of the bralani in whirlwind form must successfully save vs. paralyzation or suffer a -2 to attacks due to stinging sand in its eyes </u></b>. <b><u>Any man-size or smaller creature that approaches within 5 feet of the bralani in its whirlwind form must successfully save vs. paralyzation again or be swept off its feet by thc raging winds and thrown 10 to 30 feet </u></b>. Bralani love to careen through an enemy's ranks, knocking their foes left and right as they dance right past them.</p>
					<p>In addition to the powers all eladrins possess, bralani can use the following abilities once per round: <i>blur </i>, <i>charm person </i>, <i>control weather </i>, <i>cure disease </i>, <i>gust of wind </i>, <i>mirror image </i>, and <i>wind wall </i>. Twice per day they can cast a <i>lightning bolt </i>( <b>8d8 points of damage </b>), and <i>cure serious wounds </i>or <i>neutralize poison </i>; once per week they can <i>heal </i>another person, but not themselves.</p>
					<p>Bralani can be hit only by <b><u>+1 or better weapons, or weapons forged of cold-wrought iron </u></b>. A bralani can <i>gate </i>1d4 other bralani eladrins to his location with a 40% chance of success.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>In their native layer or Pelion, the bralani travel in loose bands in an unending dance of wind and sand. Each day the band travels hundreds of miles, stopping only to play pranks on travelers or deal with any unwanted intruders they find. The bralani don't acknowledge any one individual as leader. The entire band acts merely on spontaneous impulses, which can make these eladrins very hard to deal with.</p>
					<p>When the bralani leave Pelion, they travel in small groups of only 1 to 3 individuals. In the rare instances where the bralani have mobilized for war, they act as scouts and skirmishers, harrying the enemies flanks and rear.</p>

					<p>Most folks have heard of salamanders - the creatures appear more frequently than a body'd think, even off the Elemental Plane of Fire - but few really know the dark of them. See, the creatures've got a fairly complex life cycle.</p>
					<p>They start their existence in a larval stage, during which time they're called fire snakes. The name was bestowed by some prime long ago, and unfortunately, it stuck. Some fire snakes eventually mature into what're called lesser salamanders, while others remain as they are until they die. No one knows why this occurs.</p>
					<p>Lesser salamanders aren't spotted often by most bashers, as they rarely leave their home plane. However, experienced planewalkers know that Fire's thick with the monsters. Some, but not all, grow and develop into normal salamanders. Only one in a hundred thousand of these creatures has the potential to develop further. These special bloods, if they manage to survive for at least a thousand years, become salamander nobles. This name derives not only from their societal position as leaders, but also from their personal power - nobles're mighty foes in combat.</p>
					<p>Note:</p>
					<p>This entry describes only lesser salamanders and nobles. For more information on fire snakes and normal salamanders, refer to the Elemental, Fire Kin entry.</p>
					<p><b>Lesser Salamander</b></p>
					<p>Lesser salamanders, sometimes called flamebrothers, are fairly bestial in nature, possessing only the civilization imposed upon them by their more sophisticated superiors.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Lesser salamanders use iron weapons in combat. Many wield spears, but others brandish swords, axes, daggers, or maces, all forged entirely of red-hot iron. The body heat of a flamebrother inflicts an additional 2 points of damage upon those struck by its weapon.</p>
					<p>Lesser salamanders are <b><u>immune to fire-based attacks, and </u></b><b><i><u>sleep </u></i></b><b><u>, </u></b><b><i><u>hold </u></i></b><b><u>, and </u></b><b><i><u>charm </u></i></b><b><u>spells </u></b>. Cold-based attacks inflict 1 additional point of damage per damage die.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>These creatures of fire and heat dwell in flame-filled caverns on their home plane. They're usually encountered in huge numbers, often led by a normal salamander. Powerful creatures of the plane of Fire, such as efreet or intelligent elementals, sometimes put lesser salamanders to work as personal guards or soldiers in their armies. Vast nations of flamebrothers may be ruled by many normal salamanders, with a single salamander noble sitting above them all.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>In the hierarchy of the plane of Fire, lesser salamanders find themselves somewhere near the very bottom. They're the front-line skirmishers - in other words, the fodder - in the armies of the plane. Many spend their days tending the deep pits of flame where the larval salamanders (fire snakes) grow to maturity.</p>
					<p><b>Salamander Noble</b></p>
					<p>Enormous armies and huge kingdoms of salamanders (both lesser and normal) serve the nobles of the race, as do most other creatures of heat and flame. Occasionally, however, these formidable bloods wander about alone, even traveling to other planes. Chant is these plane-hoppers are really exiles, banished for their transgressions. Others believe that they simply search for means and methods of seizing more power and that the wandering salamander nobles are free to return to their home at any time. Both theories sound plausible.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Like their lessers, salamander nobles favor fighting with metal spears, which're often enchanted with at least a +2 or +3 bonus. The nobles' great strength adds another 4 points to the damage caused by the spears. And to make matters even worse, the great heat generated by the creatures' bodies inflicts an additional 1d6 points of fire damage to any berk struck by theyr weapons. If unarmed, a noble can grab a sod with its tail and constrict him, inflicting <b>2d8+4 points of damage </b>per round, plus another 1d6 points due to its body heat.</p>
					<p>Salamander nobles can be struck only by weapons of <b><u>+2 or better enchantment </u></b>. They're <b><u>immune to heat as well as </u></b><b><i><u>sleep </u></i></b><b><u>, </u></b><b><i><u>charm </u></i></b><b><u>, and </u></b><b><i><u>hold </u></i></b><b><u>spells </u></b>. However, they can also resist the harmful effects of hated cold, so unlike other salamanders, they suffer only normal amounts of damage from such attacks.</p>
					<p>Furthermore, these masters of fire wield potent spellcasting abilities. They can cast each of the following spells three times per day as 10th-level wizards: <i>affect normal fires </i>, <i>burning hands </i>, <i>fireball </i>, <i>flame arrow </i>, <i>flaming sphere </i>, and <i>wall of fire </i>. Once each day, a salamander noble can cast <i>conjure fire elemental </i>and a special form of dispel magic that robs a fire-resistant creature of this protection for 2d4 rounds. This spell negates <i>rings of fire resistance </i>, <i>protection from fire spells </i>, and even the natural resistance of creatures not native to the plane of Fire (such as fiends, red dragons, and so on). It doesn't work against fire elementals or other creatures native to the plane. Obviously, if cast on a plane-walking sod who's using special protections to pass safely through the Elemental Plane of Fire, it almost certainly spells his doom.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Salamander nobles recognize no authority above their own. They do their best to ignore beings like Imix or Zaaman Rul, and they stay out of the way of powers on the plane of Fire. Some fiery creatures - including certain elementals, grue, azer, mephits, hell hounds, and fire minions - look upon the nobles as masters. The efreet, as a rule, hate the salamander nobles but grudgingly respect their strength.</p>
					<p>Despite all their underlings, these powerful bloods are true loners. Since they're not a race unto themselves, they don't take mates or raise young. Lesser salamanders fear them too much to give them anything but blind obedience. If life as a salamander noble has any drawbacks, it's that the tyrant has no confidants, companions, or real allies - only servants.</p>
					<p>Most nobles live in fabulous fortresses or palaces on the Elemcntal Plane of Fire. Each is a unique individual with a very different dwelling and personality. But one thing a berk can count on is that all salamander nobles are cruel masters that spend a great deal of time and energy imposing order and organization upon their chaotic lessers.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Salamander nobles are among the more powerful creatures on the Elemental Plane of Fire. Their life spans have virtually no limit.</p>

					<p>Most folks have heard of salamanders - the creatures appear more frequently than a body'd think, even off the Elemental Plane of Fire - but few really know the dark of them. See, the creatures've got a fairly complex life cycle.</p>
					<p>They start their existence in a larval stage, during which time they're called fire snakes. The name was bestowed by some prime long ago, and unfortunately, it stuck. Some fire snakes eventually mature into what're called lesser salamanders, while others remain as they are until they die. No one knows why this occurs.</p>
					<p>Lesser salamanders aren't spotted often by most bashers, as they rarely leave their home plane. However, experienced planewalkers know that Fire's thick with the monsters. Some, but not all, grow and develop into normal salamanders. Only one in a hundred thousand of these creatures has the potential to develop further. These special bloods, if they manage to survive for at least a thousand years, become salamander nobles. This name derives not only from their societal position as leaders, but also from their personal power - nobles're mighty foes in combat.</p>
					<p>Note:</p>
					<p>This entry describes only lesser salamanders and nobles. For more information on fire snakes and normal salamanders, refer to the Elemental, Fire Kin entry.</p>
					<p><b>Lesser Salamander</b></p>
					<p>Lesser salamanders, sometimes called flamebrothers, are fairly bestial in nature, possessing only the civilization imposed upon them by their more sophisticated superiors.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Lesser salamanders use iron weapons in combat. Many wield spears, but others brandish swords, axes, daggers, or maces, all forged entirely of red-hot iron. The body heat of a flamebrother inflicts an additional 2 points of damage upon those struck by its weapon.</p>
					<p>Lesser salamanders are <b><u>immune to fire-based attacks, and </u></b><b><i><u>sleep </u></i></b><b><u>, </u></b><b><i><u>hold </u></i></b><b><u>, and </u></b><b><i><u>charm </u></i></b><b><u>spells </u></b>. Cold-based attacks inflict 1 additional point of damage per damage die.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>These creatures of fire and heat dwell in flame-filled caverns on their home plane. They're usually encountered in huge numbers, often led by a normal salamander. Powerful creatures of the plane of Fire, such as efreet or intelligent elementals, sometimes put lesser salamanders to work as personal guards or soldiers in their armies. Vast nations of flamebrothers may be ruled by many normal salamanders, with a single salamander noble sitting above them all.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>In the hierarchy of the plane of Fire, lesser salamanders find themselves somewhere near the very bottom. They're the front-line skirmishers - in other words, the fodder - in the armies of the plane. Many spend their days tending the deep pits of flame where the larval salamanders (fire snakes) grow to maturity.</p>
					<p><b>Salamander Noble</b></p>
					<p>Enormous armies and huge kingdoms of salamanders (both lesser and normal) serve the nobles of the race, as do most other creatures of heat and flame. Occasionally, however, these formidable bloods wander about alone, even traveling to other planes. Chant is these plane-hoppers are really exiles, banished for their transgressions. Others believe that they simply search for means and methods of seizing more power and that the wandering salamander nobles are free to return to their home at any time. Both theories sound plausible.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Like their lessers, salamander nobles favor fighting with metal spears, which're often enchanted with at least a +2 or +3 bonus. The nobles' great strength adds another 4 points to the damage caused by the spears. And to make matters even worse, the great heat generated by the creatures' bodies inflicts an additional 1d6 points of fire damage to any berk struck by theyr weapons. If unarmed, a noble can grab a sod with its tail and constrict him, inflicting <b>2d8+4 points of damage </b>per round, plus another 1d6 points due to its body heat.</p>
					<p>Salamander nobles can be struck only by weapons of <b><u>+2 or better enchantment </u></b>. They're <b><u>immune to heat as well as </u></b><b><i><u>sleep </u></i></b><b><u>, </u></b><b><i><u>charm </u></i></b><b><u>, and </u></b><b><i><u>hold </u></i></b><b><u>spells </u></b>. However, they can also resist the harmful effects of hated cold, so unlike other salamanders, they suffer only normal amounts of damage from such attacks.</p>
					<p>Furthermore, these masters of fire wield potent spellcasting abilities. They can cast each of the following spells three times per day as 10th-level wizards: <i>affect normal fires </i>, <i>burning hands </i>, <i>fireball </i>, <i>flame arrow </i>, <i>flaming sphere </i>, and <i>wall of fire </i>. Once each day, a salamander noble can cast <i>conjure fire elemental </i>and a special form of dispel magic that robs a fire-resistant creature of this protection for 2d4 rounds. This spell negates <i>rings of fire resistance </i>, <i>protection from fire spells </i>, and even the natural resistance of creatures not native to the plane of Fire (such as fiends, red dragons, and so on). It doesn't work against fire elementals or other creatures native to the plane. Obviously, if cast on a plane-walking sod who's using special protections to pass safely through the Elemental Plane of Fire, it almost certainly spells his doom.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Salamander nobles recognize no authority above their own. They do their best to ignore beings like Imix or Zaaman Rul, and they stay out of the way of powers on the plane of Fire. Some fiery creatures - including certain elementals, grue, azer, mephits, hell hounds, and fire minions - look upon the nobles as masters. The efreet, as a rule, hate the salamander nobles but grudgingly respect their strength.</p>
					<p>Despite all their underlings, these powerful bloods are true loners. Since they're not a race unto themselves, they don't take mates or raise young. Lesser salamanders fear them too much to give them anything but blind obedience. If life as a salamander noble has any drawbacks, it's that the tyrant has no confidants, companions, or real allies - only servants.</p>
					<p>Most nobles live in fabulous fortresses or palaces on the Elemcntal Plane of Fire. Each is a unique individual with a very different dwelling and personality. But one thing a berk can count on is that all salamander nobles are cruel masters that spend a great deal of time and energy imposing order and organization upon their chaotic lessers.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Salamander nobles are among the more powerful creatures on the Elemental Plane of Fire. Their life spans have virtually no limit.</p>

					<p>Salamanders are natives of the elemental plane of Fire, and thus they thrive in hot places. These cruel, evil creatures come to the Prime Material plane for reasons known only to them.</p>
					<p>The head and torso of a salamander is copper-colored and has a human-like appearance. Most of the time (80%), this aspect is a male, with flaming beard and moustache. The female version has flowing, fiery red hair. Both aspects have glowing yellow eyes that sometimes switch to fluorescent green. All aspects carry a shiny metal spear, resembling highly polished steel.</p>
					<p>The lower torso is that of a large snake, with orange coloring shading to dull red at the tail end. The entire body is covered with wispy appendages that appear to burn but are never consumed.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>A salamander typically attacks with its metal spear, which inflicts <b>1d6 points of damage </b>plus a like amount for the spear's heat. At the same time, it can lash out and coil around an opponent with its snake-like tail, constricting for <b>2d6 points of damage </b>, plus an additional <b>1d6 points of damage </b>from the heat of its body. While fire-resistant creatures do not suffer from the salamander's heat damage, they are still subject to the spear and constriction damage.</p>
					<p>Salamanders can be affected only by magical weaponry or by creatures of a magical nature or those of 4+1 or more Hit Dice. They are impervious to all fire-based attacks. <i>Sleep </i>, <i>charm </i>, and <i>hold </i>spells are ineffective against them. Cold-based attacks cause an additional 1 point of damage per die of damage.</p>
					<p>The head and upper body of the salamander has an AC of 5, while the lower body is AC 3.</p>
					<p>A favorite salamander tactic, if the creature is encountered in a lava pit or roaring fire, is to grab its opponents and hurl them into the flames. The victim would naturally take damage from contact with the salamander, then take even more from being thrown inside a roaring conflagration.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Salamanders are native to the elemental plane of Fire. They come to the Prime Material plane for reasons known only to them, though it is rumored that powerful wizards and priests of certain religions can summon them for a short time. Salamanders hate cold, preferring temperatures of 300 degrees or more; they can abide lower temperatures for only a few hours. Their lairs are typically at least 500 degrees. Any treasure found there is the sort that can survive this heat, such as swords, armor, rods, other ferrous items, and jewels. Things of a combustible nature, such as parchment and wood, soft metals such as gold and silver, and liquids, which quickly boil away, are never found in salamander lairs.</p>
					<p>Having a nasty disposition and an evil bent, salamanders respect only power, either the ability to resist their fire or the capability to do great damage. Anyone else is dealt a painful, slow, burning death. It is rumored that they have some sort of dealings with the efreeti.</p>
					<p>When encountered on the Prime plane, salamanders can be found playing in forest fires, lava flows, fire pits, and other areas of extreme heat. They usually appear on the Prime plane for a purpose, and if in the middle of a task they do not take kindly to being interrupted.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>These fiery creatures' ichor is useful in the creation of <i>potions of fire resistance </i>, and the metal of their spears can be used to create <i>rings of fire resistance </i>.</p>
					<p><b>Fire Snake</b></p>
					<p>Some sages say that fire snakes are larval salamanders. Fire snakes, colored in shades from blood-red to orange, are always found in fires. Some large permanent fires contain 1d6 of these creatures, though in smaller, temporary fires like fire pits and oil bowls, there may be but one snake. The only treasure the snakes have is the gems they often accumulate.</p>
					<p>Since their color matches their surroundings, they can surprise opponents easily (-4 penalty to opponents' surprise rolls). <b><u>Their bite inflicts 1d4 points of damage </u></b><u>and injects a mild venom that causes paralyzation of the victim for 2d4 turns unless a saving throw vs. poison is successful </u>.</p>

					<p><b>Air Elemental</b></p>
					<p>Air elementals can be conjured in any area of open air where gusts of wind are present. The common air elemental appears as an amorphous, shifting cloud when it answers its summons to the Prime Material plane. They rarely speak, but their language can be heard in the high-pitched shriek of a tornado or the low moan of a midnight storm.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>While air elementals are not readily tangible to the inhabitants of planes other than its own, they can strike an opponent with a strong, focused blast of air that, like a giant, invisible fist, does <b>2-20 points of damage </b>. The extremely rapid rate at which these creatures can move make them very useful on vast battlefields or in extended aerial combat. In fact, the air elemental's mastery of its natural element gives it a strong advantage in combat above the ground. In aerial battles, they gain a +1 to hit and a +4 to the damage they inflict.</p>
					<p>The most feared power of an air elemental is its ability to form a whirlwind upon command. Using this form, the air elemental appears as a truncated, reversed cone with a 10 foot bottom diameter and 30 foot top diameter. The height of the whirlwind depends on the Hit Dice of the elemental. An air elemental of 8 Hit Dice will produce a whirlwind standing 40 feet tall; a 12 Hit Dice elemental produces a whirlwind standing 60 feet tall; and a 16 Hit Dice elemental produces a whirlwind standing 80 feet tall. It takes one full turn to form and dissipate this cone.</p>
					<p>This whirlwind lasts for one melee round, sweeps away and kills all creatures under 3 Hit Dice in the area of its cone, and does <b>2-16 points of damage </b>to all creatures it fails to kill outright. If, because of overhead obstructions, the whirlwind fails to reach its full height, it can only sweep up creatures under 2 Hit Dice and do <b>1-8 points of damage </b>to all others in its cone.</p>
					<p><b>Earth Elemental</b></p>
					<p>Earth elementals can be conjured in any area of earth or stone. This type of common elemental appears on the Prime Material plane as a very large humanoid made of whatever types of dirt, stones, precious metals, and gems it was conjured from. It has a cold, expressionless face, and its two eyes sparkle like brilliant, multifaceted gems. Though it has a mouth-like opening in its face, an earth elemental will rarely speak. Their voices can be heard in the silence of deep tunnels, the rumblings of earthquakes, and the grinding of stone on stone.</p>
					<p>Though earth elementals travel very slowly, they are relentless in the fulfillment of their appointed tasks. An earth elemental can travel through solid ground or stone with no penalty to movement or dexterity. However, these elementals cannot travel through water: they must either go around the body of water in their path or go under it, traveling in the ground. Earth elementals prefer the latter as it keeps them moving, more or less, in a straight line toward their goal.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Earth elementals will always try to fight on the ground and will only rarely be tricked into giving up that advantage. Because of their close alliance to the rock and earth, these elementals do <b>4-32 points of damage </b>(4d8) whenever they strike a creature that rests on the ground.</p>
					<p>Against constructions with foundations in earth or stone, earth elementals do great damage, making them extremely useful for armies sieging a fortification. For example, a reinforced door, which might require a few rounds to shatter using conventional methods, can be smashed with ease by an earth elemental. They can even level a small cottage in a few rounds.</p>
					<p>An earth elemental's effectiveness against creatures in the air or water is limited; the damage done by the elemental's fists on airborne or waterborne targets is lessened by 2 points per die (to a minimum of 1 point of damage per die).</p>

					<p><b>Fire Elemental</b></p>
					<p>Fire elementals can be conjured in any area containing a large open flame. To provide a fire elemental with an adequate shell of Prime Material flame, a fire built to house an elemental should have a diameter of at least six feet and reach a minimum of four feet into the air.</p>
					<p>On the Prime Material Plane, a fire elemental appears as a tall sheet of flame. The fire elemental will always appear to have two armlike appendages, one on each side of its body. These arms seem to flicker back into the creature's flaming body, only to spring out from its sides seconds later. The only facial features of a fire elemental are two large glowing patches of brilliant blue fire, which seem to function as eyes for the elemental. Like all common elementals, fire elementals rarely speak on the Prime Material plane, though their voices can be heard in the crackle and hiss of a large fire.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Because they resent being conjured to this plane, fire elementals are fierce opponents who will attack their enemies directly and savagely, taking what joy they can in burning the weak creatures and objects of the Prime Material to ashes. In combat, a fire elemental lashes out with one of its ever-moving limbs, doing <b>3-24 points of damage </b>. <b><u>Any flammable object struck by the fire elemental must save versus magical fire at a -2 or immediately begin to burn </u></b>.</p>
					<p>Fire elementals do have some limitations on their actions in the Prime Material plane. They are unable to cross water or non-flammable liquids. Often, a quick dive into a nearby lake or stream is the only thing that can save a powerful party from certain death from a fire elemental. Also, because their natural abilities give them some built-in resistance to flame-based attacks, creatures with innate fire-using abilities, like red dragons, take less damage from a fire elemental's attack. The elemental subtracts 1 point from each die of damage it does to these creature (to a minimum of 1 point of damage per die).</p>
					<p><b>Water Elemental</b></p>
					<p>Water elementals can be conjured in any area containing a large amount of water or watery liquid. At least one thousand cubic feet of liquid is required to create a shell for the water elemental to inhabit. Usually a large pool serves this purpose, but several large kegs of wine or ale will do just as well.</p>
					<p>The water elemental appears on the Prime Material Plane as a high-crested wave. The elemental's arms appear as smaller waves, one thrust out on each side of its main body. The arms ebb and flow, growing longer or shorter as the elemental moves. Two orbs of deep green peer out of the front of the wave and serve the elemental as eyes. Like all other common elementals, water elemental rarely speak on the Prime Material Plane, but their voices can be heard in the crashing of waves on rocky shores and the howl of an ocean gale.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>In combat, the water elemental is a dangerous adversary. It prefers to fight in a large body of water where it can constantly disappear beneath the waves and suddenly swell up behind its opponent. When the elemental strikes, it lashes out with a huge wave-like arm, doing <b>5-30 points of damage </b>.</p>
					<p>Water elementals are also a serious threat to ships that cross their paths. A water elemental can easily overturn small craft (one ton of ship per hit die of the elemental) and stop or slow almost any vessel (one ton of ship per hit point of the elemental). Ships not completely stopped by an elemental will be slowed by a percentage equal to the ratio of ship's tons over the hit points of the attacking elemental.</p>
					<p>Though the water elemental is most effective in large areas of open water, it can be called upon to serve in a battle on dry land, close to the body of water from which it arose. However, the movement of the water elemental on land is the most restricted of any elemental type: a water elemental cannot move more than 60 yards away from the water it was conjured from, and 1 point of damage is subtracted from each die of damage they inflict out of the water (to a minimum of 1 point of damage per die).</p>

					<p>The azer are a race of humanoid creatures that normally inhabit the Elemental Plane of Fire. Except under special circumstances, they are very rarely found on the Prime Material Plane.</p>
					<p>In appearance they are much like dwarves, except that they have metallic, brass-colored skin and flames for hair. They wear only kilts or apronlike garments of beaten brass, copper, or bronze.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Azer use broad-bladed javelins that inflict damage as spears. In hand-to-hand combats they employ malletlike weapons equal to a footman's mace. Due to their great strength, their attack and damage rolls are adjusted as follows:</p>
					<table>

					</table>
					<p>Creatures not <b><u>immune to fire suffer 1d4+1 points of damage </u></b><u>if grasped by an azer, and the heat of an azer's weapons inflicts an additional +1 damage to such victims </u>. Azer suffer double damage from cold-based attacks.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Azer on their home plane are part of an extremely regimented society where every individual has his or her place. The azer civilization in general is heavily stratified, with law taking precedence over individual freedoms and even an individual's life.</p>
					<p>Azer construct their outposts and cities as towers built from basalt, granite, or metal. There they dwell in small groups, using their plentiful complexes of flames to shape the stone.</p>
					<p>They grow strange trees with metallic outer skins or barks, and the leaves of these trees are actually made entirely of metal - in some cases, precious metals.</p>
					<p>Azer are unfriendly and taciturn, and they lack compassion. They capture and interrogate intruders; particularly dangerous or violent prisoners are slain. They are greedy, particularly for gems that are a clear purple or red (rubies, amethysts, garnets, etc.) Once given, the word of an azer is a solid bond.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>It is not known just what if anything azer eat. On their home plane, their only enemies are other intelligent fire dwelling creatures, and even then this enmity is not related to relative position on the food chain. The greatest of their enemies are the efreet, who sometimes fight wars of conquest against the azer, taking their territories and making slaves of them. The azer defend themselves and their towers with powerful, bellows-like air projectors and special containers used to pour elemental water on attackers.</p>
					<p><b>Amaimon</b></p>
					<p>Amaimon is the legendary king of the ager. He is the largest (9+8 HD), strongest (18/00 strength), and most intelligent of all azer. He has 35% magic resistance; his other powers are unknown.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Nobles</b></p>
					<p>Amaimon's nobles number from 8d4 and are only slightly weaker than their king (7+6 HD, 18/76-90 Strength). They have 25% magic resistance; the noble azers' full powers are also unknown.</p>

					<p><b>Air Mephit</b></p>
					<p>Most maneuverable in flight of all mephits, air mephits are flighty in personality as well. Fickle, untrustworthy, and empty-headed, these mephits make excellent messengers and couriers - for their first mission. Thereafter they flee their creators to explore the planes, attach themselves to whomever looks interesting and make entertaining trouble.</p>
					<p>Air mephits look like pure white muscular humanoids from the waist up and white tornadoes from the waist down. Unlike most other mephits, they have no wings but fly on their airstreams; they display astonishing agility. They are bald with broad grins and small ears, and they often wear one gold earring.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Air mephits favor sudden ambush attacks and quick escapes. An air mephit attacks with two claws ( <b>1d3 damage </b>each). To use its breath weapon, the mephit inhales sand, dirt, or other particles in the vicinity and then blows the grit at high velocity at one target within 10' (hits automatically for <b>1d6 damage </b>). The mephit can blow once every other round withut limit, as long as it finds sufficient grit in the vicinity.</p>
					<p>Once per hour air mephits can cast <i>blur </i>on themselves at 3rd level of magic use. Once per day they can cast <i>gust of wind </i>.</p>
					<p>Air mephits are <b><u>immune to air and gas attacks of all kinds </u></b>. They regenerate 1 hp per turn automatically. They die instantly and vanish in a vacuum.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>A confined mephit can freshen and cool the air in stuffy rooms. Spellcasters unaccustomed to hot weather sometimes bring them along on trips to hot Lower Planes.</p>
					<p><b>Smoke Mephit</b></p>
					<p>Smoke mephits are crude and lazy. They spend most of their time sitting around invisible, smoking pipeweed, telling bad jokes about their creators, and generally shirking their responsibilities.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>A smoke mephit's two clawed hands cause <b>1d2 damage </b>each. Its breath weapon consists of a sooty ball usable every other melee round, an unlimited number of times per day. This sooty hall automatically strikes one creature of the mephit's choice within 20' ( <b>1d4 damage </b>and blinded for 1-2 rounds), no saving throw.</p>
					<p>Smoke mephits can cast <i>invisibility </i>and <i>dancing lights </i>once each per day. Once per hour, they can attempt to <i>gate </i>in 1-2 other mephits, fire, magma, smoke, or steam. If two rnephits arrive, they are the same type.</p>
					<p>Contact with any kind of smoke lets a smoke mephit regenerate 1 hp per turn. When a smoke mephit dies, it disappears in a flash of flame. This flash causes 1 hp damage to all creatures within 10'.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Lower-planar beings traditionally dispatch a smoke mephit as a gift to enemies, a gesture of insolence and contempt that amounts to a declaration of vendetta.</p>

					<p><b>Dust Mephit</b></p>
					<p>These ghoulish things find death morbidly fascinating. They pose as tragic yet fashionable victims of a gloomy fate, heroically holding out against utter insanity. They favor lines like 'A dust mephit I am, lest dust I become!'</p>
					<p>Gaunt even by mephit standards, dust mephits have dusky brown skin, eyes, and wings. Unlike other mephits, they prefer to wear clothing (always black), altered so as not interfere with flight.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Dust mephits attack with two weak claws ( <b>1d2 damage </b>each). Three times a day they can breathe a 15'-radius cloud of irritating glassy dust (range 0). <b><u>Those who fail to save vs. breath weapon can avoid the effect by scratching for one round </u></b>. Otherwise the itching lowers AC by 4 and attack rolls by 2 for three rounds. Other mephits and creatures with thick or insensitive skins (elephant, scaly, buffalo) are immune.</p>
					<p>Once per hour a dust mephit can attempt to <i>gate </i>in 1-2 other dust mephits, usually to share their tragic alienation.</p>
					<p>They regenerate 1 hp per turn in dusty, waterless areas. They take half damage from cutting and impaling weapons and are <b><u>immune to heat and fire damage of all types, but take maximum damage from liquid- and wind-based attacks </u></b>.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>In the complex social code of some lower-planar spellcasters, the gift of a dust mephit symbolizes a subtle threat, with the connotation that the giver has recognized some plot of the recipient against him.</p>
					<p><b>Salt Mephit</b></p>
					<p>Salt mephits look like grainy white humanoids with wings made of cubical white crystals. They have large red eyes and gaping, grinning mouths. They have no odor unless they get wet, which causes them excruciating pain and makes them smell briny. The sarcastic and acidulous wit of salt mephits lowers their life expectancy dramatically.</p>
					<p><b><u></u></b></p>
					<p></p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p><b><u>Salt mephits attack with two claws ( 1d3 damage </u></b><u>each); if any claw damage penetrates armor, the pain of the salted wound requires a save vs. petrification or the victim is stunned for 1-2 rounds </u>. <b><u>Similarly, the salt mephit's breath weapon is a shower of salt crystals against a single enemy within 15' (damage 1d4, save vs. petrification or be stunned 1-2 rounds) </u></b>.</p>
					<p>Once per day a salt mephit can <i>taunt </i>(as the 1st-level wizard spell); this taunting can be made to originate within 10 yards of the mephit. A salt mephit can contaminate any amount of water up to a barrel by touch, turning it into undrinkable brine.</p>
					<p>Once per hour a salt mephit can attempt to <i>gate </i>in another salt mephit. Salt mephits are <b><u>immune to fire and heat damage of all kinds, but take maximum damage from liquid-based attacks, and even ordinary water does 1 hp damage per round of contact </u></b>. They regenerate 1 hp per turn automatically, as long as they stay dry.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Spellcasters who deliver a nasty, foulmouthed salt mephit to an enemy thereby declare open warfare.</p>

					<p><b>Earth Mephit</b></p>
					<p>These heavy, rocky mephits have stolid, humorless personalities. Stubborn and <b><u>immune to insult, they look like small, thin earth elementals, with stony skin, glittering eyes, and rigid wings of dull metal </u></b>. Their wings, which never flap, seem to play no role in the mephit's magical flight. Earth mephits fly clumsily and smell like dirt.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Earth mephits have two fist attacks ( <b>1d4 damage </b>each). Once per day, they can grow to a height of 10' for one turn; their fists do <b>2d6 damage </b>at this size.</p>
					<p>Three times a day an earth mephit can spit a rock at one target within 15' hitting automatically ( <b>1d6 damage </b>). Additional uses of this attack beyond the third cost the mephit 2 hp apiece from its current total.</p>
					<p>Once per hour an earth mephit can attempt to <i>gate </i>in 1-2 other mephits, either earth or magma. If two arrive, they are the same type.</p>
					<p>Earth mephits regenerate 1 hp per round they spend buried in earth to at least waist level. <i>Passwall </i>and <i>transmute rock to mud </i>spells destroy them instantly.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Earth mephits need no food or drink to survive, but they enjoy the taste of gems and jewelry. To gain these they pursue money-making schemes, always with single-mindedness but also singular ineptitude.</p>
					<p><b>Ooze Mephit</b></p>
					<p>These unctuous creatures sidle up to strangers and, in purring, sibilant voices, use flattery to ingratiate themselves. 'Oooh, what sssplendid armor! You know, you wear that armor with sssuch, sssuch authority, I feel myssself quite overwhelmed.' After a few minutes of this, or as much as the target can stand, the mephit asks for 'a loan' of 100 gold pieces.</p>
					<p>Ooze mephits are made of ochre muck, just like their home plane. They have a rough humanoid form hut no clear joints, and their wings are transparent green bubble membranes that seldom break. They have dark green eyes and mouth with a mooning expression, and they smell absolutely terrible in a 30' radius. Contact with an ooze mephit stains clothing permanently.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Ooze mephits attack with two claws ( <b>1d3 damage </b>each), but avoid combat when possible. Their breath weapon, usable every other round without limit, is an invisible cloud of gas that works as a <i>stinking cloud </i>(no range, 10' radius) cast at 3rd level of magic use. Other mephits are immune.</p>
					<p>Once per hour an ooze mephit can <i>gate </i>in another ooze mephit. Ooze mephits are <b><u>immune to cutting or impaling damage and to fire and water attacks of all types, but </u></b><b><i><u>transmute mud to rock </u></i></b><b><u>destroys them instantly </u></b>. They regenerate 1 hp per round in stagnant water.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Ooze mephits are created to clean sewage lines, maintain garbage dumps, and carry out other necessary but unpleasant duties. They quickly desert and become beggars. With the money they beg, ooze mephits hire wizards to transform them into more desirable forms: humans, elves, dwarves, even kobolds.</p>

					<p><b>Fire Mephit</b></p>
					<p>The most mischievous of all mephits, these fiends play terrible pranks on other mephits, such as pushing magma mephits into water and watching them harden.</p>
					<p>Fire mephits are small, wiry humanoids with bright red skin and bat-wings. Some fire mephits affect a mustache, goatee, and tiny horns on their forehead, but these are always faked.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Touching a fire mephit causes 1 hp heat damage. Its two clawed hands rake for <b>1d3 damage </b>each plus 1 hp heat damage per hit.</p>
					<p>Fire mephits can use their breath weapon three times a day. <b><u>In one form it is a flame jet 15' long and 1' wide that automatically hits one chosen target ( 1d8+1 damage </u></b><u>; save vs. breath weapon for half damage) </u>. The second form, a fan of flame, covers a 120 arc in front of the mephit to a distance of five feet. Any creature in the arc suffers 4 hp damage (no save).</p>
					<p>Fire mephits can also cast <i>magic missile </i>(two missiles) and <i>heat metal </i>spells once each per day. Once per hour a fire mephit can attempt to <i>gate </i>in another mephit, either fire, magma, smoke or steam.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Fire mephits sometimes prove useful heating forges, warming bedclothes, or lighting cigars.</p>
					<p><b>Radiant Mephit</b></p>
					<p>Prone to non sequiturs and glazed looks, radiant mephits appear permanently, blissfully dazed by the glories of the quasi-plane of Radiance. They peer fixedly at people and say things like, 'Have you too seen the majesty of the Ultimate Light? Oh, look at that amazing reflection on your armor there! Nice. Sorry, was I talking?' They take overblown names as do other mephits, hut never remember them.</p>
					<p>Radiant mephits have silvery bodies that perfectly reflect their surroundings like a mirror, large black eyes, and thin prismatic wings. They have wide mouths, but their faces are usually expressionless, except during their sudden fits of crazed giggling.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Radiant mephits can attack with two claws ( <b>1d3 damage </b>each). They can cast <i>color spray </i>once per turn at 6th level of magic use. However, unless directly attacked, they usually become distracted and forget their opponents.</p>
					<p>Once per hour a radiant mephit can attempt to <i>gate </i>in another radiant mephit.</p>
					<p>Radiant mephits are <b><u>immune to all spells that affect or work through vision, including </u></b><b><i><u>color spray </u></i></b><b><u>and visual illusions, but they receive no saving throws against mind-affecting magic </u></b>. They have infravision to 120'. In strong light they regenerate 1 hp per turn.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Radiant mephits lack the attention span to carry out missions. They are created primarily because some powerful beings of lawful alignment find their <i>color sprays </i>(dim recreations of the plane of Radiance) soothing or mesmerizing.</p>

					<p><b>Water Mephit</b></p>
					<p>These thin, finny humanoids are covered with sea-green scales, and webs of skin connect the spines of their ears, toes, and wings. They have fishy, staring eyes and fish lips. An odor of brine accompanies them, and they drip salt water.</p>
					<p>Manifesting an irritating joviality, water mephits make remarkably tactless comments on their companions' actions and situations: 'Buck up, you can handle these fiends. Or if not, you'll make good dretches.' They attach themselves to adventuring parties (unasked) out of an appetite for novelty.</p>
					<p><b><u></u></b></p>
					<p></p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p><b><u>Water mephits can attack with two claws ( 1d3 damage </u></b><u>each), but they prefer their breath weapon, a stream of acidic greenish water (2d4 acid damage for two rounds; one save vs. breath weapon halves damage on both rounds) </u>. The mephit can breathe every other round, automatically hitting one target.</p>
					<p>The semi-liquid forms of water mephits are <b><u>immune to cutting or impaling damage from nonmagical weapons and to fire damage (including magical fire), but they take double damage from cold attacks </u></b>. Of course they can breathe water, and they can drink any liquid, such as mercury or poison without damage. They regenerate 1 hp per round spent only drinking liquid. Water mephits can attempt to <i>gate </i>in one other water or ice mephit once per hour.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Captured water mephits stand watch in kitchens, ready to put out fires, or maintain aquaria for the wealthy.</p>
					<p><b>Ice Mephit</b></p>
					<p>Ice mephits are angular, with translucent, ice-blue skin. They live on the colder Lower Planes and thus never mix with fire, magma, smoke, or steam mephits. Ice mephits act aloof and cruel, surpassing other mephits in torture and wanton destruction.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Ice mephits attack with two clawed hands ( <b>1d2 damage </b>each). In addition, their chilling touch reduces the victim's attack rolls by 1 per hit. These effects are cumulative and last three turns, or until the victim is healed to full hit points, whichever comes first.</p>
					<p>Ice mephits can breathe a volley of ice shards every other melee round, up to three times per day. <b><u>This volley automatically hits a single victim within 15' ( 1d6 damage </u></b><u>, save vs. breath weapon for half damage) </u>.</p>
					<p>Once per hour an ice mephit can attempt to <i>gate </i>in one other mephit, either mist or ice.</p>
					<p>Ice mephits are of course <b><u>immune to all cold-based attacks, but take full damage from fire- or heat-based attacks </u></b>.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Confined ice mephits chill small rooms for the cold storage of perishables.</p>

					<p><b>Magma Mephit</b></p>
					<p>Magma mephits, or <i>lava mephits </i>, are the least intelligent of all mephits and hence the brunt of fire mephit jokes. They are sensitive to these insults and anger easily when offended, but otherwise they are passive and less temperamental than other mephits. They generate extreme heat that can be felt 30' away.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Magma mephit claws are small and soft, causing only 1 hp damage when they hit, but each hit inflicts an additional 1d8 heat damage and automatically melts or burns most nonmagical materials. The rate of destruction varies from three rounds (melting plate armor) to one hour (burning through an inch of wood).</p>
					<p>Their breath weapon, usable once every three rounds, is a blob of lava that automatically hits one target within 10' ( <b>1d6 damage </b>). A magma mephit can use this weapon eight times, then must recharge for one hour in a lava pool. Mephits in lava regenerate 2 hp per round.</p>
					<p>Magma mephits can shapechange into a pool of lava 3' in diameter and six inches deep. This maneuver does not recharge their breath weapon. They take damage normally in pool form.</p>
					<p>Once per hour a magma mephit can attempt to <i>gate </i>in 1-2 other mephits of fire, magma, smoke, or steam. If two arrive they are the same type.</p>
					<p>Water in large quantities (a barrel or more) causes the magma mephit to harden, halving its movement. <b><u>However, this releases large quantities of sulfurous steam, necessitating a save vs. poison for any creatures within 10' </u></b>. Failure causes dizziness and nausea for two rounds, and the victim takes -2 on attack rolls.</p>
					<p><b>Ash Mephit</b></p>
					<p>Profoundly depressed and lugubrious, ash mephits make adequate sentries and messengers, but they impose upon passersby with endless tales of their sorrows, boredom, and frustrations.</p>
					<p>Ash mephits have powdery gray skin and wings ('You're so lucky not to have wings, they get fouled in everything and it's not like I ever asked to fly'), no external ears ('And even so I hear this persistent ringing, a ringing, you know, it just never stops'), and a nasal whining voice ('Am 1 boring you? I'd haaate to think I was boring you'). <b><u>Scholars suppose that lower-planar beings can create ash mephits more easily than those of other types: why else would anyone create one?</u></b></p>
					<p><b><u></u></b></p>
					<p></p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p><b><u>Ash mephits cannot claw or bite, but they can spray a cloud of choking ash in a 10' radius at a cost of 1 hp from their current total ( 1d6 damage </u></b><u>, save vs. breath weapons for half damage) </u>.</p>
					<p>Once per day an ash mephit can harangue good and neutral creatures with a lengthy recitation of its woes. This works as <i>Leomund's lamentable belaborment </i>(It does not work on evil creatures, who care nothing for the mephit's troubles.)</p>
					<p>Ash mephits are <b><u>immune to nonmagical cutting and impaling weapons, to fire, heat, and cold (magical and nonmagical), and to poison </u></b>. They take double damage from liquid-based attacks, and wind-based attacks inflict maximum damage. They do not breathe.</p>
					<p>Once an hour an ash mephit can gate in another ash mephit (usual to commiserate)</p>

					<p><b>Earth Mephit</b></p>
					<p>These heavy, rocky mephits have stolid, humorless personalities. Stubborn and <b><u>immune to insult, they look like small, thin earth elementals, with stony skin, glittering eyes, and rigid wings of dull metal </u></b>. Their wings, which never flap, seem to play no role in the mephit's magical flight. Earth mephits fly clumsily and smell like dirt.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Earth mephits have two fist attacks ( <b>1d4 damage </b>each). Once per day, they can grow to a height of 10' for one turn; their fists do <b>2d6 damage </b>at this size.</p>
					<p>Three times a day an earth mephit can spit a rock at one target within 15' hitting automatically ( <b>1d6 damage </b>). Additional uses of this attack beyond the third cost the mephit 2 hp apiece from its current total.</p>
					<p>Once per hour an earth mephit can attempt to <i>gate </i>in 1-2 other mephits, either earth or magma. If two arrive, they are the same type.</p>
					<p>Earth mephits regenerate 1 hp per round they spend buried in earth to at least waist level. <i>Passwall </i>and <i>transmute rock to mud </i>spells destroy them instantly.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Earth mephits need no food or drink to survive, but they enjoy the taste of gems and jewelry. To gain these they pursue money-making schemes, always with single-mindedness but also singular ineptitude.</p>
					<p><b>Ooze Mephit</b></p>
					<p>These unctuous creatures sidle up to strangers and, in purring, sibilant voices, use flattery to ingratiate themselves. 'Oooh, what sssplendid armor! You know, you wear that armor with sssuch, sssuch authority, I feel myssself quite overwhelmed.' After a few minutes of this, or as much as the target can stand, the mephit asks for 'a loan' of 100 gold pieces.</p>
					<p>Ooze mephits are made of ochre muck, just like their home plane. They have a rough humanoid form hut no clear joints, and their wings are transparent green bubble membranes that seldom break. They have dark green eyes and mouth with a mooning expression, and they smell absolutely terrible in a 30' radius. Contact with an ooze mephit stains clothing permanently.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Ooze mephits attack with two claws ( <b>1d3 damage </b>each), but avoid combat when possible. Their breath weapon, usable every other round without limit, is an invisible cloud of gas that works as a <i>stinking cloud </i>(no range, 10' radius) cast at 3rd level of magic use. Other mephits are immune.</p>
					<p>Once per hour an ooze mephit can <i>gate </i>in another ooze mephit. Ooze mephits are <b><u>immune to cutting or impaling damage and to fire and water attacks of all types, but </u></b><b><i><u>transmute mud to rock </u></i></b><b><u>destroys them instantly </u></b>. They regenerate 1 hp per round in stagnant water.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Ooze mephits are created to clean sewage lines, maintain garbage dumps, and carry out other necessary but unpleasant duties. They quickly desert and become beggars. With the money they beg, ooze mephits hire wizards to transform them into more desirable forms: humans, elves, dwarves, even kobolds.</p>

					<p><b>Dust Mephit</b></p>
					<p>These ghoulish things find death morbidly fascinating. They pose as tragic yet fashionable victims of a gloomy fate, heroically holding out against utter insanity. They favor lines like 'A dust mephit I am, lest dust I become!'</p>
					<p>Gaunt even by mephit standards, dust mephits have dusky brown skin, eyes, and wings. Unlike other mephits, they prefer to wear clothing (always black), altered so as not interfere with flight.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Dust mephits attack with two weak claws ( <b>1d2 damage </b>each). Three times a day they can breathe a 15'-radius cloud of irritating glassy dust (range 0). <b><u>Those who fail to save vs. breath weapon can avoid the effect by scratching for one round </u></b>. Otherwise the itching lowers AC by 4 and attack rolls by 2 for three rounds. Other mephits and creatures with thick or insensitive skins (elephant, scaly, buffalo) are immune.</p>
					<p>Once per hour a dust mephit can attempt to <i>gate </i>in 1-2 other dust mephits, usually to share their tragic alienation.</p>
					<p>They regenerate 1 hp per turn in dusty, waterless areas. They take half damage from cutting and impaling weapons and are <b><u>immune to heat and fire damage of all types, but take maximum damage from liquid- and wind-based attacks </u></b>.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>In the complex social code of some lower-planar spellcasters, the gift of a dust mephit symbolizes a subtle threat, with the connotation that the giver has recognized some plot of the recipient against him.</p>
					<p><b>Salt Mephit</b></p>
					<p>Salt mephits look like grainy white humanoids with wings made of cubical white crystals. They have large red eyes and gaping, grinning mouths. They have no odor unless they get wet, which causes them excruciating pain and makes them smell briny. The sarcastic and acidulous wit of salt mephits lowers their life expectancy dramatically.</p>
					<p><b><u></u></b></p>
					<p></p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p><b><u>Salt mephits attack with two claws ( 1d3 damage </u></b><u>each); if any claw damage penetrates armor, the pain of the salted wound requires a save vs. petrification or the victim is stunned for 1-2 rounds </u>. <b><u>Similarly, the salt mephit's breath weapon is a shower of salt crystals against a single enemy within 15' (damage 1d4, save vs. petrification or be stunned 1-2 rounds) </u></b>.</p>
					<p>Once per day a salt mephit can <i>taunt </i>(as the 1st-level wizard spell); this taunting can be made to originate within 10 yards of the mephit. A salt mephit can contaminate any amount of water up to a barrel by touch, turning it into undrinkable brine.</p>
					<p>Once per hour a salt mephit can attempt to <i>gate </i>in another salt mephit. Salt mephits are <b><u>immune to fire and heat damage of all kinds, but take maximum damage from liquid-based attacks, and even ordinary water does 1 hp damage per round of contact </u></b>. They regenerate 1 hp per turn automatically, as long as they stay dry.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Spellcasters who deliver a nasty, foulmouthed salt mephit to an enemy thereby declare open warfare.</p>

					<p>Both mist and steam mephits originate on the quasielemental Plane of Steam, the only known plane that has spawned two varieties of mephits. Possibly for this reason, the two varieties have developed an intense rivalry bordering on hatred. They insult one another constantly and fight inconclusive skirmishes.</p>
					<p><b>Mist Mephit</b></p>
					<p>Mist mephits fancy themselves spies of the highest caliber. They quickly report other mephits who show mercy or other treasonous behavior, and they seldom engage in idle banter with other mephits.</p>
					<p>Mist mephits can see clearly in fog or mist. Their skin is pale green.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Mist mephits seldom engage in melee unless trapped. Their soft claws inflict 1 hp damage. <b><u>They can breathe a sickly-green ball of mist every other round, up to three times an hour, that automatically envelops one victim within 10' (save vs. poison or take ld4+1 points of choking damage and blinded for 1-4 rounds) </u></b>.</p>
					<p>Mist mephits can create a <i>wall of fog </i>once per day, as a 3rd-level wizard. They can also assume <i>gaseous form </i>once per day, and often do so to spy on others or escape combat. Once per hour, a mist mephit can attempt to <i>gate </i>in 1-2 other mephits, either ice or mist. If two arrive, they are the same type.</p>
					<p>Powerful winds, including a <i>gust of wind </i>spell, cause mist mephits to flee in confusion.</p>
					<p><b>Steam Mephit</b></p>
					<p>Bossy and hypersensitive, steam mephits are the self-appointed overlords of all mephits and, in their own minds, lords of the quasiplane of Steam. Mist mephits refuse to obey them, and this disobedience has led to a millennia-long rivalry between the types.</p>
					<p>In addition to the hissing steam that escapes from their pores, steam mephits leave a trail of near-boiling water where they walk.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Unlike other mephits who delay attacking as long as possible, steam mephits, ruled by oversized egos, ambush even large, well-armed parties. They strike first with their boiling rainstorm, then concentrate their breath weapons on the nearest wizard or priest.</p>
					<p>The mephit's two hardened claws cause <b>1d4 damage </b>each, plus 1 hp heat damage per touch. In addition, the victim is 50% likely to be stunned for one round. These effects are cumulative, so a victim raked twice could be stunned for two rounds.</p>
					<p>Steam mephits can breathe a scalding jet of water every other round with a 20' range, automatically hitting one target ( <b>1d3 damage </b>, with a 50% chance of stunning the victim for one round).</p>
					<p>Once per day a steam mephit can create a rainstorm of boiling water over a 20'x20' area. This storm inflicts <b>2d6 damage </b>to all victims in the area of effect. Steam mephits can also use <i>putrefy food &#38; drink </i>(reverse of <i>purify food and drink </i>) once per day to contaminate water.</p>
					<p>Once per hour a steam mephit can attempt to <i>gate </i>in 1-2 other mephits (fire, magma, smoke, or steam). If two arrive, they are the same type.</p>
					<p>Steam mephits are <b><u>immune to fire and heat damage </u></b>.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Steam mephits heat confined areas or power small engines.</p>

					<p><b>Water Mephit</b></p>
					<p>These thin, finny humanoids are covered with sea-green scales, and webs of skin connect the spines of their ears, toes, and wings. They have fishy, staring eyes and fish lips. An odor of brine accompanies them, and they drip salt water.</p>
					<p>Manifesting an irritating joviality, water mephits make remarkably tactless comments on their companions' actions and situations: 'Buck up, you can handle these fiends. Or if not, you'll make good dretches.' They attach themselves to adventuring parties (unasked) out of an appetite for novelty.</p>
					<p><b><u></u></b></p>
					<p></p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p><b><u>Water mephits can attack with two claws ( 1d3 damage </u></b><u>each), but they prefer their breath weapon, a stream of acidic greenish water (2d4 acid damage for two rounds; one save vs. breath weapon halves damage on both rounds) </u>. The mephit can breathe every other round, automatically hitting one target.</p>
					<p>The semi-liquid forms of water mephits are <b><u>immune to cutting or impaling damage from nonmagical weapons and to fire damage (including magical fire), but they take double damage from cold attacks </u></b>. Of course they can breathe water, and they can drink any liquid, such as mercury or poison without damage. They regenerate 1 hp per round spent only drinking liquid. Water mephits can attempt to <i>gate </i>in one other water or ice mephit once per hour.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Captured water mephits stand watch in kitchens, ready to put out fires, or maintain aquaria for the wealthy.</p>
					<p><b>Ice Mephit</b></p>
					<p>Ice mephits are angular, with translucent, ice-blue skin. They live on the colder Lower Planes and thus never mix with fire, magma, smoke, or steam mephits. Ice mephits act aloof and cruel, surpassing other mephits in torture and wanton destruction.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Ice mephits attack with two clawed hands ( <b>1d2 damage </b>each). In addition, their chilling touch reduces the victim's attack rolls by 1 per hit. These effects are cumulative and last three turns, or until the victim is healed to full hit points, whichever comes first.</p>
					<p>Ice mephits can breathe a volley of ice shards every other melee round, up to three times per day. <b><u>This volley automatically hits a single victim within 15' ( 1d6 damage </u></b><u>, save vs. breath weapon for half damage) </u>.</p>
					<p>Once per hour an ice mephit can attempt to <i>gate </i>in one other mephit, either mist or ice.</p>
					<p>Ice mephits are of course <b><u>immune to all cold-based attacks, but take full damage from fire- or heat-based attacks </u></b>.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Confined ice mephits chill small rooms for the cold storage of perishables.</p>

					<p><b>Fire Elemental</b></p>
					<p>Fire elementals can be conjured in any area containing a large open flame. To provide a fire elemental with an adequate shell of Prime Material flame, a fire built to house an elemental should have a diameter of at least six feet and reach a minimum of four feet into the air.</p>
					<p>On the Prime Material Plane, a fire elemental appears as a tall sheet of flame. The fire elemental will always appear to have two armlike appendages, one on each side of its body. These arms seem to flicker back into the creature's flaming body, only to spring out from its sides seconds later. The only facial features of a fire elemental are two large glowing patches of brilliant blue fire, which seem to function as eyes for the elemental. Like all common elementals, fire elementals rarely speak on the Prime Material plane, though their voices can be heard in the crackle and hiss of a large fire.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Because they resent being conjured to this plane, fire elementals are fierce opponents who will attack their enemies directly and savagely, taking what joy they can in burning the weak creatures and objects of the Prime Material to ashes. In combat, a fire elemental lashes out with one of its ever-moving limbs, doing <b>3-24 points of damage </b>. <b><u>Any flammable object struck by the fire elemental must save versus magical fire at a -2 or immediately begin to burn </u></b>.</p>
					<p>Fire elementals do have some limitations on their actions in the Prime Material plane. They are unable to cross water or non-flammable liquids. Often, a quick dive into a nearby lake or stream is the only thing that can save a powerful party from certain death from a fire elemental. Also, because their natural abilities give them some built-in resistance to flame-based attacks, creatures with innate fire-using abilities, like red dragons, take less damage from a fire elemental's attack. The elemental subtracts 1 point from each die of damage it does to these creature (to a minimum of 1 point of damage per die).</p>
					<p><b>Water Elemental</b></p>
					<p>Water elementals can be conjured in any area containing a large amount of water or watery liquid. At least one thousand cubic feet of liquid is required to create a shell for the water elemental to inhabit. Usually a large pool serves this purpose, but several large kegs of wine or ale will do just as well.</p>
					<p>The water elemental appears on the Prime Material Plane as a high-crested wave. The elemental's arms appear as smaller waves, one thrust out on each side of its main body. The arms ebb and flow, growing longer or shorter as the elemental moves. Two orbs of deep green peer out of the front of the wave and serve the elemental as eyes. Like all other common elementals, water elemental rarely speak on the Prime Material Plane, but their voices can be heard in the crashing of waves on rocky shores and the howl of an ocean gale.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>In combat, the water elemental is a dangerous adversary. It prefers to fight in a large body of water where it can constantly disappear beneath the waves and suddenly swell up behind its opponent. When the elemental strikes, it lashes out with a huge wave-like arm, doing <b>5-30 points of damage </b>.</p>
					<p>Water elementals are also a serious threat to ships that cross their paths. A water elemental can easily overturn small craft (one ton of ship per hit die of the elemental) and stop or slow almost any vessel (one ton of ship per hit point of the elemental). Ships not completely stopped by an elemental will be slowed by a percentage equal to the ratio of ship's tons over the hit points of the attacking elemental.</p>
					<p>Though the water elemental is most effective in large areas of open water, it can be called upon to serve in a battle on dry land, close to the body of water from which it arose. However, the movement of the water elemental on land is the most restricted of any elemental type: a water elemental cannot move more than 60 yards away from the water it was conjured from, and 1 point of damage is subtracted from each die of damage they inflict out of the water (to a minimum of 1 point of damage per die).</p>

					<p>Though their lives span several human generations, elves appear at first glance to be frail when compared to man. However, elves have a number of special talents that more than make up for their slightly weaker constitutions.</p>
					<p>High elves, the most common type of elf, are somewhat shorter than men, never growing much over than 5 feet tall. Male elves usually weigh between 90 and 120 pounds, and females weigh between 70 and 100 pounds. Most high elves are dark-haired, and their eyes are a beautiful, deep shade of green. They posses infravision up to 60 feet. The features of an elf are delicate and finely chiseled.</p>
					<p>Elves have very pale complexions, which is odd because they spend a great deal of time outdoors. They tend to be slim, almost fragile. Their pale complexion and slight builds are the result of a constitution that is weaker than man's. Elves, therefore, always subtract 1 point from their initial Constitution score. Though they are not as sturdy as humans, elves are much more agile, and always add 1 point to their initial Dexterity scores.</p>
					<p>Elven clothing tends to be colorful, but not garish. They often wear pastel colors, especially blues and greens. Because they dwell in forests, however, high elves often wear greenish grey cloaks to afford them quick camouflage.</p>
					<p>Elves have learned that it is very important to understand the creatures, both good and evil, that share their forest home. Because of this, elves may speak the tongues of goblins, orcs, hobgoblins, gnolls, gnomes, and halflings, in addition to common and their own highly-developed language. They will always show an interest in anything that will allow them to communicate with, and learn from, their neighbors.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Elves are cautious fighters and always use their strengths to advantage if possible. One of their greatest strengths is the ability to pass through natural surroundings, woods, or forests, silently and almost invisibly. By moving quietly and blending into vegetation for cover, elves will often surprise a person or party (opponents have a surprise modifier of -4). As long as they are not attacking, the elves hiding in the forest can only be spotted by someone or something with the ability to see invisible objects. The military value of this skill is immense, and elven armies will always send scouts to spy on the enemy, since such spies are rarely caught - or even seen.</p>
					<p>Although their constitutions are weak, elves posses an extremely strong will, such strong wills, in fact, that they have a 90% <b><u>immunity to all </u></b><b><i><u>charm </u></i></b><b><u>and </u></b><b><i><u>sleep </u></i></b><b><u>spells </u></b>. And even if their natural resistance to these spells fails, they get a normal saving throw - making it unlikely an elf will fall victim to these spells very often.</p>
					<p>Elves live in the wild, so weapons are used for everything from dealing with the hostile creatures around their camps, to such mundane tasks as hunting for dinner. The elves' rigorous training with bows and swords, in addition to their great dexterity, gives them a natural bonus of +1 to hit when fighting with a short or long sword, or when using a bow of any kind, other than a crossbow. Elves are especially proficient in the use of the bow. Because of their agility, elves can move, fire a bow, and move again, all in the same round. Their archers are extremely mobile, and therefore dangerous.</p>
					<p>Because of limitations of horses in forest combat, elves do not usually ride. Elves prefer to fight as foot soldiers and are generally armed as such. Most elves wear scale, ring, or chain mail, and almost all high elves carry shields. Although elves have natural bonuses when they use bows and swords, their bands carry a variety of weapons. The weapons composition of a band of elves is: spear 30%; sword 20%; sword and spear 20%; sword and bow 10%; bow 15%; two-handed sword 5%.</p>
					<p>Elven fighters and multi-class fighters have a 10% chance per level to possess a magical item of use to his or her class. This percentage is cumulative and can be applied to each major type of magical item that character would use-for each class in the case of multi-class characters. (For example, a fighter/priest of level 4 or 5 would have a 40% chance to have a magical item useful to fighters and a 50% chance of having an item useful to priests.) In addition, if above 4th level, elven mages gain the same percentage chance to gain items, but gain 2-5 magical items useful to them if a successful roll is made.</p>
					<p>For every 20 elves in a group, there will be one 2nd- or 3rd-level fighter (50% chance of either). For every party of 40 elves, and in addition to the higher level fighter, there will be a 1st- or 2nd-level mage (again, 50% chance of either). If 100 or more elves are encountered, the following additional characters will be present: two 4th-level fighter; one 8th-level mage; and a 4th-level fighter/4th-level mage/4th-level thief. Finally, if over 160 elves are encountered, they will be led by two 6th-level fighter/6th-level mage/6th-level thief. These two extremely powerful leaders will have two retainers each-a 4th-level fighter/5th-level mage, and a 3rd-level fighter/3rd-level mage/3rd-level thief. All of these are in addition to the total number of elves in the band.</p>
					<p>Elven women are the equal of their male counterparts in all aspects of warfare. In fact, some bands of elves will contain units of female fighters, who will be mounted on unicorns. This occurs rarely (5% chance), and only 10-30 elf maidens will be encountered in such a unit. However, the legends of the destruction wrought by these elven women are rampant among the enemies of the elves.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Elves value their individual freedom highly and their social structure is based on independent bands. These small groups, usually consisting of no more than 200, recognize the authority of a royal overlord, who in turn owes allegiance to a king or queen. However, the laws and restraints set upon elven society are very few compared to human society and practically negligible when compared to dwarven society.</p>
					<p>Elven camps are always well-hidden and protected. In addition to the large number of observation posts and personnel traps set around a camp, high elves typically set 2-12 giant eagles as guardians of their encampments (65% of the time). For every 40 elves encountered in a camp, there will be the following high level elves, as well as the leaders noted above: a 4th-level fighter, a 4th-level cleric, and a 2nd-level fighter/2nd-level mage/2nd-level thief. A 4th-level fighter/7th-level mage, a 5th-level fighter, a 6th-level fighter, and a 7th-level cleric will also be present. Females found in a camp will equal 100%, children 50%, of the males encountered.</p>
					<p>Because elves live for several hundred years, their view of the world is radically different from most other sentient beings. Elves do not place much importance on short-term gains nor do they hurry to finish projects. Humans see this attitude as frivolous; the elves simply find it hard to understand why everyone else is always in such a rush.</p>
					<p>Elves prefer to surround themselves with things that will bring them joy over long periods of time - things like music and nature. The company of their own kind is also very important to elves, since they find it hard to share their experiences or their perspectives on the world with other races. This is one of the main reasons elven families are so close. However, as friendship, too is something to be valued, even friends of other races remain friends forever.</p>
					<p>Though they are <b><u>immune to a few specific spells, elves are captivated by magic </u></b>. Not specific spells, of course, but the very concept of magic. Cooperation is far more likely to be had from an elf, by offering an obscure, even worthless, (but interesting) magical item, than it is with two sacks of gold. Ultimately, their radically different perspective separates the elves from the rest of their world. Elves find dwarves too dour and their adherence to strict codes of law unpleasant. However, elves do recognize dwarven craftsmanship as something to be praised. Elves think a bit more highly of humans, though they see man's race after wealth and fleeting power as sad. In the end, after a few hundred years, all elves leave the world they share with dwarves and men, and journey to a mysterious land where they live freely for the rest of their extremely long lives.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Elves produce fine clothes, beautiful music, and brilliant poetry. It is for these things that other cultures know the folk of the forest best. In their world within the forest, however, elves hold in check the dark forces of evil, and the creatures that would plunder the forest and then move on to plunder another. For this reason alone, elves are irreplaceable.</p>
					<p><b>Grey Elf (Faerie)</b></p>
					<p>Grey elves have either silver hair and amber eyes, or pale golden hair and violet eyes (the violet-eyed ones are known as faerie elves). They favor bright garments of white, gold, silver, or yellow, and wear cloaks of deep blue or purple. Grey elves are the rarest of elves, and they have little to do with the world outside their forests. They value intelligence very highly, and, unlike other elves, devote much time to study and contemplation. Their treatises on nature are astounding.</p>
					<p>Grey elves value their independence from what they see as the corrupting influence of the outside world, and will fight fiercely to maintain their isolation. All grey elves carry swords, and most wear chain mail and carry shields. For mounts, grey elves will ride hippogriffs (70%) or griffons (30%). Those that ride griffons will have 3-12 griffons for guards in their camps, instead of giant eagles.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Wood Elf</b></p>
					<p>Also called <i>sylvan elves </i>, wood elves are the wild branch of the elf family. They are slightly darker in complexion than high elves, their hair ranges in color from yellow to coppery-red, and their eyes are light brown, light green, or hazel. They wear clothes of dark browns and greens, tans and russets, to blend in with their surroundings. Wood elves are very independent and value strength over intelligence. They will avoid contact with strangers 75% of the time.</p>
					<p>In battle, wood elves wear studded leather or ring mail, and 50% of their band will be equipped with bows. Only 20% of wood elves carry swords, and only 40% use spears. Wood elves prefer to ambush their enemies, using their ability to hide in the forest until their foes are close at hand. In most cases (70%), wood elf camps are guarded by 2-8 giant owls (80%) or by 1-6 giant lynx (20%). These elves speak only elf and the languages of some forest animals, and the treant. Wood elves are more inclined toward neutrality than good, and are not above killing people who stumble across their camps, in order to keep their locations secret.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Half-Elf</b></p>
					<p>Half-elves are of human stock, and have features of both the elf and human parents. They are slightly taller than common elves, growing as tall as 5 1/2 feet and weighing up to 150 pounds. Though they do not gain the natural sword or bow bonuses from their elven relatives, but they do have normal elven infravision.</p>
					<p>A half-elf can travel freely between most elven and human settlements, though occasionally prejudice will be a problem. The half-elf's life span is their biggest source of grief, however. Since a half-elf lives more than 125 years, he or she will outlive any human friends or relatives, but grow old too quickly to be a real part of elven society. Many half-elves deal with this by traveling frequently between the two societies, enjoying life as it comes; the best of both worlds. Half-elves may speak common, elf, gnome, halfling, goblin, hobgoblin, orc, and gnoll.</p>

					<p>These dreaded, evil creatures were once part of the community of elves that still roam the world's forests. Now these dark elves inhabit black caves and winding tunnels under the earth, where they make dire plans against the races that still walk beneath the sun, on the surface of the green earth.</p>
					<p>Drow have black skin and pale, usually white hair. They are shorter and more slender than humans, seldom reaching more than 5 feet in height. Male drow weigh between 80 and 110 pounds, and female between 95 and 120 pounds. Drow have finely chiseled features, and their fingers and toes are long and delicate. Like all elves, they have higher Dexterity and lower Constitution than men.</p>
					<p>Drow clothing is usually black, functional, and often possesses special properties, although it does not radiate magic. For example, drow cloaks and boots act as if they are cloaks of and boots of elvenkind, except that the wearer is only 75% likely to remain undetected in shadows or to surprise enemies. <b><u>The material used to make drow cloaks does not cut easily and is fire resistant, giving the cloaks a +6 bonus to saving throws vs. fire </u></b>. These cloaks and boots fit and function only for those of elven size and build. Any attempt to alter a drow cloak has a 75% chance of unraveling the material, making it useless.</p>
					<p>In the centuries they've spent underground, drow have learned the languages of many of the intelligent creatures of the underworld. Besides their own tongue, an exotic variant of elvish, drow speak both common and the subterranean trade language used by many races under the earth. They speak the languages of gnomes and other elves fluently.</p>
					<p>Drow also have their own silent language composed of both signed hand movements and body language. These signs can convey information, but not subtle meaning or emotional content. If within 30 feet of another drow, they can also use complex facial expressions, body movements, and postures to convey meaning. Coupled with their hand signs, these expressions and gestures give the drow's silent language a potential for expression equal to most spoken languages.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>The drow's world is one in which violent conflict is part of everyday life. It should not be surprising then, that most drow encountered, whether alone or in a group, are ready to fight. Drow encountered outside of a drow city are at least 2nd-level fighters. (See Society note below.)</p>
					<p>Drow wear finely crafted, non-encumbering, black mesh armor. This extremely strong mail is made with a special alloy of steel containing adamantite. The special alloy, when worked by a drow armorer, yields mail that has the same properties of chain mail +1 to +5, although it does not radiate magic. Even the lowliest drow fighters have, in effect, chain mail +1, while higher level drow have more finely crafted, more powerful, mail. (The armor usually has a +1 for every four levels of experience of the drow wearing it.)</p>
					<p>Dark elves also carry small shields (bucklers) fashioned of adamantite. Like drow armor, these special shields may be +1,+2, or even +3, though only the most important drow fighters have +3 bucklers.</p>
					<p>Most drow carry a long dagger and a short sword of adamantite alloy. These daggers and swords can have a +1 to +3 bonus, and drow nobles may have daggers and swords of +4 bonus. Some drow (50%) also carry small crossbows that can be held in one hand and will shoot darts up to 60 yards. <b><u>The darts only inflict 1-3 points of damage </u></b><u>, but dark elves commonly coat them with poison that renders a victim unconscious, unless he rolls a successful saving throw vs. poison, with a -4 penalty </u>. The effects last 2d4 hours.</p>
					<p>A few drow carry adamantite maces (+1 to +5 bonus) instead of blades. Others carry small javelins coated with the same poison as the darts. They have a range of 90 yards with a short range bonus of +3, a +2 at medium, and a +1 at long.</p>
					<p>Drow move silently and have superior infravision (120 feet). They also have the same intuitive sense about their underground world as dwarves do, and can detect secret doors with the same chance of success as other elves. A dark elf can only be surprised by an opponent on a roll of 1 on 1dl0.</p>
					<p>All dark elves receive training in magic, and are able to use the following spells once per day: <i>dancing lights </i>, <i>faerie fire </i>, and <i>darkness </i>. Drow above 4th level can use <i>levitate </i>, <i>know alignment </i>, and <i>detect magic </i>once per day. Drow priests can also use <i>detect lie </i>, <i>clairvoyance </i>, <i>suggestion </i>, and <i>dispel magic </i>once per day. (See also Wizard Spells, <i>Player's Handbook </i>)</p>
					<p>Perhaps it is the common use of magic in drow society that has given the dark elves their incredible resistance. Drow have a base resistance to magic of 50%, which increases by 2% for each level of experience. (Multi-classed drow gain the bonus from only the class in which they have the highest level. <b><u>) All dark elves save vs. all forms of magical attack (including devices) with a +2 bonus </u></b>. <b><u>Thus, a 5th-level drow has a 60% base magic resistance and a +2 bonus to her saving throws vs. spells that get past her magic resistance </u></b>.</p>
					<p>Drow encountered in a group always have a leader of a higher level than the rest of the party. If 10 or more drow are encountered, a fighter/mage of at least 3rd level in each class is leading them. If 20 drow are encountered, then, in addition to the higher level fighter/mage, there is a fighter/priest of at least the 6th level in both classes. If there are more than 30, up to 50% are priests and the leader is at least a 7th-level fighter/8th-level priest, with a 5th-level fighter/4th-level mage for an assistant, in addition to the other high level leaders.</p>
					<p>Dark elves do have one great weakness - bright light. Because the drow have lived so long in the earth, rarely venturing to the surface, they are no longer able to tolerate bright light of any kind. Drow within the radius of a <i>light </i>or <i>continual light </i>spell are 90% likely to be seen. In addition, they lose 2 points from their Dexterity and attack with a -2 penalty inside the area of these spells. Characters subject to spells cast by drow affected by a <i>light </i>or <i>continual light </i>spell add a +2 bonus to their saving throws. If drow are attacking a target that is in the area of effect of a light or continual light spell, they suffer an additional -1 penalty to their attack rolls, and targets of drow magical attacks save at an additional +1. These penalties are cumulative (i.e., if both the drow and their targets are in the area of effect of a light spell, the drow suffer a -3 penalty to their attack rolls and the targets gain a +3).</p>
					<p>Because of the serious negative effects of strong light on the drow, they are 75% likely to leave an area of bright light, unless they are in battle. Light sources like torches, lanterns, magical weapons, or <i>faerie fire </i>spells, do not affect drow.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Long ago, dark elves were part of the elven race that roamed the world's forests. Not long after they were created, though, the elves found themselves torn into rival factions - one following the tenets of evil, the other owning the ideals of good (or at least neutrality). A great civil war between the elves followed, and the selfish elves who followed the paths of evil and chaos were driven into the depths of the earth, into the bleak, lightless caverns and deep tunnels of the underworld. These dark elves became the drow.</p>
					<p>The drow no longer wish to live upon the surface of the earth. In fact, few who live on the surface ever see a drow. But the dark elves resent the elves and faeries who drove them away, and scheme against those that dwell in the sunlight.</p>
					<p>Drow live in magnificently dark, gloomy cities in the underworld that few humans or demihumans ever see. They construct their buildings entirely out of stone and minerals, carved into weird, fantastic shapes. Those few surface creatures that have seen a dark elf city (and returned to tell the tale) report that it is the stuff of which nightmares are made.</p>
					<p>Drow society is fragmented into many opposing noble houses and merchant families, all scrambling for power. In fact, all drow carry brooches inscribed with the symbol of the merchant or noble group they are allied with, though they hide these and do not show them often. The drow believe that the strongest should rule; their rigid class system, with a long and complicated list of titles and prerogatives, is based on the idea.</p>
					<p>They worship a dark goddess, called Lolth by some, and her priestesses hold very high places in society. Since most drow priests are female, women tend to fill nearly all positions of great importance.</p>
					<p>Drow fighters go through rigorous training while they are young. Those who fail the required tests are killed at the program's conclusion. That is why dark elf fighters of less than 2nd level are rarely seen outside a drow city.</p>
					<p>Drow often use giant lizards as pack animals, and frequently take bugbears or troglodytes as servants. Drow cities are havens for evil beings, including mind flayers, and drow are allied with many of the underworld's evil inhabitants. On the other hand, they are constantly at war with many of their neighbors beneath the earth, including dwarves or dark gnomes (svirfneblin) who settle to close to a drow city. Dark elves frequently keep slaves of all types, including past allies who have failed to live up to drow expectations.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>The drow produce unusual weapons and clothing with quasi-magical properties. Some scribes and researchers suggest that it is the strange radiation around drow cities that make drow crafts special. Others theorize that fine workmanship gives their wonderfully strong metals and superior cloth its unique attributes. Whatever the reason, it's clear that the drow have discovered some way to make their clothing and weapons without the use of magic.</p>
					<p>Direct sunlight utterly destroys drow cloth, boots, weapons, and armor. When any item produced by them is exposed to the light of the sun, irreversible decay begins. Within 2d6 days, the items lose their magical properties and rot, becoming totally worthless. Drow artifacts, protected from sunlight, retain their special properties for ld20+30 days before becoming normal items. If a drow item is protected from direct sunlight and exposed to the radiations of the drow underworld for one week out of every four, it will retain its properties indefinitely.</p>
					<p>Drow sleep poison, used on their darts and javelins, is highly prized by traders on the surface. However, this poison loses its potency instantly when exposed to sunlight, and remains effective for only 60 days after it is exposed to air. Drow poison remains potent for a year if kept in an unopened packet.</p>
					<p><b>Driders</b></p>
					<p>These strange creatures have the head and torso of a drow and the legs and lower body of a giant spider. Driders are created by the drow's dark goddess. When a dark elf of above-average ability reaches 6th level, the goddess may put him or her through a special test. Failures become driders.</p>
					<p>Driders are able to cast all spells a normal drow can use once per day. They also retain any magical or clerical skills they had before transformation. A majority of driders (60%) were priests of 6th or 7th level before they were changed, all other driders were mages of 6th, 7th, or 8th level.</p>
					<p>Driders always fight as 7 Hit Die monsters. They often use swords or axes, though many carry bows. <b><u>Driders can bite for ld4 points of damage, and those bitten must save vs. poison with a -2 penalty or be paralyzed for 1-2 turns </u></b>.</p>
					<p>Because they have failed their goddess's test, driders are outcasts from their own communities. Driders are usually found alone or with 2d6 huge spiders (10% chance), rather than with drow or other driders. They are violent, aggressive creatures that favor blood over all types of food. They stalk their victims tirelessly, waiting for the right chance to strike.</p>

					<p>Ettercaps are ugly bipedal creatures that get along very well with all types of giant spiders. These creatures of low intelligence are exceedingly cruel, very cunning, and are skilled in setting traps - very deadly traps - much like the spiders that often live around them.</p>
					<p>Ettercaps stand around six feet tall, even with their stooping gait and hunched shoulders. The creatures have short, spindly legs, long arms that reach nearly to their ankles, and large pot-bellies. The hands of ettercaps have a thumb and three long fingers that end in razor sharp claws. Their bodies are covered by tufts of thick, wiry, black hair, and their skin is dark and thick. Ettercaps' heads are almost equine in shape, but they have large reptilian eyes, usually blood-red in color, and large fangs, one protruding downward from each side of the mouth. The mouth itself is large and lined with very sharp teeth.</p>
					<p>Ettercaps do not have a formal language. They express themselves through a combination of high-pitched chittering noises, shrieks, and violent actions.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>If caught in a battle, an ettercap first strikes with its claws, causing <b>1-3 points of damage </b>with each set. The creature then tries to bite its opponent, inflicting <b>1d8 points of damage </b>with its teeth and powerful jaws. A successful bite attack by an ettercap enables the monster to inject its victim with a powerful poison from the glands above the ettercap's fangs.</p>
					<p>The poison secreted by an ettercap is highly toxic and very similar to the poison of giant spiders. <b><u>A creature injected with it must immediately roll a saving throw vs. poison </u></b>. A failed roll means that the creature dies within 1d4 turns when the toxigen paralyzes the victim's heart.</p>
					<p>Many adventurers never get the chance to raise a sword against ettercaps because of the devious traps they use for protection. Ettercaps prefer to ambush unwary travelers and lead them into traps rather than fight them face to face.</p>
					<p>Like spiders, ettercaps have silk glands located in their abdomen. The thin, strong strands of silvery silk-like material these glands secrete are used by ettercaps to construct elaborate traps made up of nets, trip wires, garottes, and anything else the monsters can make out of the strands. The traps are designed so that they often immobilize the adventurer who stumbles into it. If this is the case, ettercaps never hesitate to attack that character first, trying to poison the victim before he escapes. Different ettercaps prefer different trap designs, so encounters with different ettercaps should expose the adventurer to new traps each time.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Ettercaps prefer to dwell in the deepest part of a forest, near paths that are frequented by game or travelers. The creatures' nests are made of a frame of strands filled with rotting leaves and moss. The lairs are often located on the ground, but can also be found up in large, sturdy trees. No treasure is to be found in ettercap lairs, but occasionally items dropped by adventurers who have fallen into ettercap traps are found nearby.</p>
					<p>Though usually only one ettercap is encountered at any time, on rare occasions a pair of ettercaps can be found together. The pairs encountered are always mated couples, though the female and male appear to be identical. Ettercap young are abandoned as soon as they are born, so adults are never encountered with young.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>An ettercap eats any meat, regardless of the type of creature from which it comes. Upon capturing a victim, the ettercap poisons it so it cannot escape; once the creature is dead, the ettercap immediately devours as much of the corpse as possible. Typically, an ettercap can consume an entire deer or a large humanoid in a single sitting. Anything remaining after the ettercap has gorged itself is left for scavengers.</p>
					<p>Often (40%), 2d4 spiders of some monstrous type are found cooperating with an ettercap. The ettercap uses any giant spider webs available when it designs its traps. Creatures killed by an ettercap in the web of a giant spider are shared with the spider instead of being devoured entirely by the ettercap.</p>
					<p>Ettercap poison is highly valued, partly because of its extreme toxicity and partly because it is rather difficult to obtain. An ettercap's poison glands hold only one ounce of poison at any time, but this ounce is worth up to 1,000 gp on the open market.</p>

					<p>Native to Arcadia, formians are also called centaur ants. As their moniker indicates, they appear to he upright-walking ants, but their sentience is that of warmblooded creatures as opposed to insects. They've always inhabited Arcadia, and sages say they always will. Though formians found on the Prime make war on each other, Arcadian formians of different hives have learned to live together peaceably.</p>
					<p>Similar to true ants, there are three basic types of formians: the worker, the warrior, and the myrmarch. (A fourth type, the queen, is extremely rare.) Unlike ants, formians' waists are flexible; thus, they often move with only four legs, their heads and thoraces raised. Their forelegs are jointed at the wrist and have three opposing claws, which they can use to manipulate objects and to attack. Formians come in various subdued colors, which serve no function other than to indicate their cities of origin</p>
					<p>The worker, the smallest of the four formian types, is also the most commonly encountered. It's about the size of a large dog. Its claws are somewhat clumsy, though they make efficient tools for manual labor. The warrior is the size of a pony, and its claws are indicative of its capability to defend the hive. The myrmarch is the size of a horse. Its claws are capable of finer manipulation than that of human hands. Lastly, the queen is half again as large as a mvrmarch. She is in charge of administering the city and never leaves the central hive, and therefore her legs have atrophied.</p>
					<p>Formians of warrior level and higher can communicate with humans, though their version of common sounds more like eerie chittering. They communicate with one another in their own speech, which is incomprehensible to most other beings.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>When workers attack (a rare occurrence, for they're used only if a city's under siege), they use their small mandibles to bite for <b>1d4 points of damage </b>. <b><u>Warriors attack with their mandibles, two forelegs, and a stinger that injects poison, causing 2d4 points of damage </u></b><u>(save versus poison or suffer -2 to attack rolls for 1d6 turns) </u>. Myrmarches attack with their mandibles and a poisoned sting. <b><u>The poison causes 3d12 points of damage </u></b><u>and paralyzes opponents for 1d4 turns (save versus poison to take half damage and avoid paralyzation) </u>. Queens cannot attack.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Unlike true ants, formians do not have a hive mind. Though they can receive messages from the hive queen (and can even be commanded and directly controlled by her), they are capable of acting independently of the queen if need be. However, formians of lower levels automatically respond to the direct commands of their superiors. Thus, a worker responds to the warrior, the myrmarch, and the queen, while a myrmarch can only he commanded by the queen.</p>
					<p>A formian queen is protected at all times by 20 mymmrches, who will gladly sacrifice themselves for her, since she cannot move on her own. Her intelligence is at the supra-genius level, and she can control an entire hive at any time if she needs to. However, most queens allow their subjects some measure of free will.</p>
					<p>Formians are born into their station, and that station never changes. There's never been a revolution in the annals of formian history. It seems the formians, like the modrons, have no conception of aspiring to higher stations. They simply are the way they are.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Some of the most magnificent cities in Arcadia are the constructions of the centaur ants. Many of these metropolises can house more than 10,000 formians. Though they appear to be normal (that is, 'human') cities with structures and walls above ground, they extend far underground for many miles. The architecture underneath the sands is truly extraordinary - the formian buildings are said to rival that of Sigil. This is perhaps all the more extraordinary knowing that formians do not use any building method known to people.</p>

					<p>Fungi are simple plants that lack chlorophyll, true stems, roots, and leaves. Fungi are incapable of photosynthesis and live as parasites or saprophytes.</p>
					<p><b>Ordinary Fungi</b></p>
					<p>Ordinary fungi are well known to man: molds, yeast, mildew, mushrooms, and puffballs. These plants include both useful and harmful varieties.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Ordinary fungi do not attack or defend themselves, but they are prolific and can spread where unwanted.</p>
					<p>Adventurers who have lost rations to mold or clothing to mildew have had unpleasant encounters with fungi.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>The bodies of most true fungi consist of slender cottony filaments. Anyone who wishes to see this for himself need only leave a damp piece of bread in a cupboard for a day or two. Examining the black mold on the bread with a magnifying glass will show off not only the filaments, but also the spore bodies at the top of these. The spores are what gives mold its color.</p>
					<p>Most fungi reproduce asexually by cell division, budding, fragmentation, or spores. Those that reproduce sexually alternate a sexual generation (gametophyte) with a spore-producing (sporophyte) one. Fungi grow best in dark, damp environments, which they can find all too easily in a kitchen cupboard, backpack, or boot. A warm environment is preferred by some, such as yeasts and certain molds, but excessive heat kills fungi.</p>
					<p>Proper storage and cleanliness can be used to avoid most ordinary fungi.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Fungi break down organic matter, thus playing an important part in the nitrogen cycle by decomposing dead organisms into ammonia. Without the action of mushrooms and bracket fungi, soil renewal could not take place as readily as it does.</p>
					<p>Fungi are also useful to man for many purposes. Yeasts are valuable as fermenting agents, raising bread and brewing wines, beers, and ales. Certain molds are important for cheese production. The color in blue cheese is a mold that has been encouraged to grow in this semisoft cheese.</p>
					<p>Many fungi are edible, and connoisseurs consider some to be delicious. Pigs are used to hunt for truffles, an underground fungus that grows near tree roots and gives food a piquant flavor. No one has as yet managed to cultivate truffles -- an enterprising botanist could make a mint by learning to grow these.</p>
					<p>Mushrooms, the fruiting body of another underground fungus, can sometimes be eaten, but can be so poisonous that the novice mushroom hunter is allowed but one mistake in picking. The mycelium producing a single mushroom might extend beneath the ground for several feet in any direction. Medicinally, green molds (such as penicillium) can be used as folk remedies for various bacterial infections.</p>
					<p>An alchemist expert in the ways of fungi can produce a variety of useful substances from their action on various materials.</p>
					<p><b>Violet Fungus</b></p>
					<p>Violet fungus growths resemble shriekers, and are usually (75%) encountered with them. The latter are <b><u>immune to the touch of violet fungi, and the two types of creatures complement each other's existence </u></b>.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Violet fungi favor rotted animal matter to grow upon. Each fungus has one to four branches with which it flails out if any animal comes within range (see following). <b><u>The excretion from these branches rots flesh in one round unless a successful saving throw vs. poison is rolled or a </u></b><b><i><u>cure disease </u></i></b><b><u>spell is used </u></b>. The branch length of this fungi depends upon the fungi's size. Violet fungi range from four to seven feet tall, the smallest having one-foot-long branches, the five-foot-tall fungi having two-foot-long branches, and so on. Any sized growth can have up to four branches.</p>
					<p><b>Shrieker</b></p>
					<p>Shriekers are normally quiet, mindless fungi that are ambulatory. They are dangerous to dungeon explorers because of the hellish racket they make.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Light within 30 feet or movement within 10 feet causes a shrieker to emit a piercing shriek that lasts for 1-3 rounds. This noise has a 50% chance of attracting wandering monsters each round thereafter.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>They live in dark places beneath the ground, often in the company of violet fungi. When the shriekers attract curious dungeon dwellers by their shrieking, the violet fungi are able to kill them with their branches, leaving plenty of organic matter for these saprophytic life forms to feed on.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Purple worms and shambling mounds greatly prize shriekers as food, and don't seem to mind the noise while eating.</p>
					<p>Shrieker spores are an important ingredient in <i>potions of plant control </i>.</p>
					<p><b>Phycomid</b></p>
					<p>The algae-like phycomids resemble fibrous blobs of decomposing, milk-colored matter with capped fungi growing out of them. They exude a highly alkaline substance (like lye) when attacking.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>These fungoid monsters have sensory organs for heat, sound, and vibrations located in several clusters. When phycomids attack, they extrude a tube and discharge the alkaline fluid in small globules that have a range of 1d6+6 feet.</p>
					<p>In addition to alkaline damage, the globs that these creatures discharge might also cause victims to serve as hosts for new phycomid growth. <b><u>If a victim fails a saving throw vs. poison, the individual begins to sprout mushroom-like growths in the infected area </u></b>. This occurs in 1d4+4 rounds and inflicts <b>1d4+4 points of damage </b>. The growths then spread throughout the host body, killing it in 1d4+4 turns, and turning it into a new phycomid. A <i>cure disease </i>spell will stop the spread through the host.</p>
					<p><b>Ascomoid</b></p>
					<p>Ascomoids are huge, puffball-like fungi with very thick, leathery skin. They move by rolling.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>At first, an ascomoid's movement is slow - 3 for the first round, 6 the next, then 9, then finally 12 - but they can keep it up for hours without tiring.</p>
					<p>Ascomoids attack by rolling into or over opponents. Small- and medium-sized opponents are knocked down and must rise during the next round or remain prone.</p>
					<p>The creature's surface is covered with numerous pocks which serve as sensory organs. Each pock can also emit a jet of spores to attack dangerous enemies. Large opponents or those who have inflicted damage upon the ascomoids are always attacked by spore jets. The stream of spores is about one foot in diameter and 30 feet long. Upon striking, the stream puffs into a cloud of variable diameter (five to 20 feet). <b><u>The creatures under attack must roll a successful saving throw vs. poison or die from infection in their internal systems in 1d4 rounds </u></b>. Even those who save are blinded and choked to such an extent that they require 1d4 rounds to recover and rejoin melee. Meanwhile, they are nearly helpless, and all attacks upon them gain a +4 bonus to attack rolls with no shield or Dexterity bonuses allowed.</p>
					<p>Different types of weapons affect the ascomoid differently. Piercing weapons, such as spears, score double damage. Shorter stabbing weapons do damage as if against a small-sized opponent. Blunt weapons do not harm ascomoids; slashes and cuts from edged weapons cause only 1 point of damage. An ascomoid saves against magical attacks, such as <i>magic missiles </i>, <i>fireballs </i>, and lightning, with a +4 bonus to the saving throw; damage is only 50% of normal. (Cold-based attacks are at normal probabilities and damage.) As these fungi have no minds by ordinary standards, all spells affecting the brain ( <i>charm </i>, <i>ESP </i>, etc.), unless specific to plants, are useless.</p>
					<p><b>Gas Spore</b></p>
					<p>At any distance greater than 10 feet, a gas spore is 90% likely to be mistaken for a beholder. Even at close ranges there is a 25% possibility that the creature is seen as a beholder, for a gas spore has a false central eye and rhizome growths atop it that strongly resemble the eye stalks of a beholder.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>If the spore is struck for even 1 point of damage it explodes. <b><u>Every creature within a 20-foot radius suffers 6d6 points of damage </u></b><u>(3d6 if a saving throw vs. wands is successful) </u>.</p>
					<p>If a gas spore makes contact with exposed flesh, the spore shoots tiny rhizomes into the living matter and grows through the victim's system within one round. The gas spore dies immediately. The victim must have a <i>cure disease </i>spell cast on him within 24 hours or die, sprouting 2d4 gas spores.</p>

					<p>Light within 30 feet or movement within 10 feet causes a shrieker to emit a piercing shriek that lasts for 1-3 rounds. This noise has a 50% chance of attracting wandering monsters each round thereafter.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>They live in dark places beneath the ground, often in the company of violet fungi. When the shriekers attract curious dungeon dwellers by their shrieking, the violet fungi are able to kill them with their branches, leaving plenty of organic matter for these saprophytic life forms to feed on.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Purple worms and shambling mounds greatly prize shriekers as food, and don't seem to mind the noise while eating.</p>
					<p>Shrieker spores are an important ingredient in <i>potions of plant control </i>.</p>
					<p><b>Phycomid</b></p>
					<p>The algae-like phycomids resemble fibrous blobs of decomposing, milk-colored matter with capped fungi growing out of them. They exude a highly alkaline substance (like lye) when attacking.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>These fungoid monsters have sensory organs for heat, sound, and vibrations located in several clusters. When phycomids attack, they extrude a tube and discharge the alkaline fluid in small globules that have a range of 1d6+6 feet.</p>
					<p>In addition to alkaline damage, the globs that these creatures discharge might also cause victims to serve as hosts for new phycomid growth. <b><u>If a victim fails a saving throw vs. poison, the individual begins to sprout mushroom-like growths in the infected area </u></b>. This occurs in 1d4+4 rounds and inflicts <b>1d4+4 points of damage </b>. The growths then spread throughout the host body, killing it in 1d4+4 turns, and turning it into a new phycomid. A <i>cure disease </i>spell will stop the spread through the host.</p>
					<p><b>Ascomoid</b></p>
					<p>Ascomoids are huge, puffball-like fungi with very thick, leathery skin. They move by rolling.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>At first, an ascomoid's movement is slow - 3 for the first round, 6 the next, then 9, then finally 12 - but they can keep it up for hours without tiring.</p>
					<p>Ascomoids attack by rolling into or over opponents. Small- and medium-sized opponents are knocked down and must rise during the next round or remain prone.</p>
					<p>The creature's surface is covered with numerous pocks which serve as sensory organs. Each pock can also emit a jet of spores to attack dangerous enemies. Large opponents or those who have inflicted damage upon the ascomoids are always attacked by spore jets. The stream of spores is about one foot in diameter and 30 feet long. Upon striking, the stream puffs into a cloud of variable diameter (five to 20 feet). <b><u>The creatures under attack must roll a successful saving throw vs. poison or die from infection in their internal systems in 1d4 rounds </u></b>. Even those who save are blinded and choked to such an extent that they require 1d4 rounds to recover and rejoin melee. Meanwhile, they are nearly helpless, and all attacks upon them gain a +4 bonus to attack rolls with no shield or Dexterity bonuses allowed.</p>
					<p>Different types of weapons affect the ascomoid differently. Piercing weapons, such as spears, score double damage. Shorter stabbing weapons do damage as if against a small-sized opponent. Blunt weapons do not harm ascomoids; slashes and cuts from edged weapons cause only 1 point of damage. An ascomoid saves against magical attacks, such as <i>magic missiles </i>, <i>fireballs </i>, and lightning, with a +4 bonus to the saving throw; damage is only 50% of normal. (Cold-based attacks are at normal probabilities and damage.) As these fungi have no minds by ordinary standards, all spells affecting the brain ( <i>charm </i>, <i>ESP </i>, etc.), unless specific to plants, are useless.</p>
					<p><b>Gas Spore</b></p>
					<p>At any distance greater than 10 feet, a gas spore is 90% likely to be mistaken for a beholder. Even at close ranges there is a 25% possibility that the creature is seen as a beholder, for a gas spore has a false central eye and rhizome growths atop it that strongly resemble the eye stalks of a beholder.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>If the spore is struck for even 1 point of damage it explodes. <b><u>Every creature within a 20-foot radius suffers 6d6 points of damage </u></b><u>(3d6 if a saving throw vs. wands is successful) </u>.</p>
					<p>If a gas spore makes contact with exposed flesh, the spore shoots tiny rhizomes into the living matter and grows through the victim's system within one round. The gas spore dies immediately. The victim must have a <i>cure disease </i>spell cast on him within 24 hours or die, sprouting 2d4 gas spores.</p>

					<p>These monsters are ferocious predators of a magical nature, typically found amid ruins or dwelling in underground caverns. They have their own guttural language.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Gargoyles attack anything they detect, regardless of whether it is good or evil, 90% of the time. They love best to torture prey to death when it is helpless.</p>
					<p>These winged creatures are excellent fighters with four attacks per round. Their claw/claw/bite/horn combination can inflict up to 16 points of damage, while their naturally tough hide protects them from victim's attacks.</p>
					<p>Gargoyles favor two types of attack: surprise and swooping. Counting on their appearance as sculptures of some sort, gargoyles sit motionless around the rooftop of a building, waiting for prey to approach. Alternatively, a gargoyle may pose in a fountain, or a pair of the horrid beasts sit on either side of a doorway. When the victim is close enough, the gargoyles suddenly strike out, attempting only to injure the victim rather than to kill it all at once. (To a gargoyle, inflicting a slow, painful death is best.)</p>
					<p>When on the move, gargoyles sometimes use a 'swoop' attack, dropping down suddenly from the sky to make their attacks in an aerial ambush. In this case, they can make either two claw attacks or one horn attack. To make all four of their attacks, they must land.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Gargoyles live in small groups with others of their kind, interested in little more than finding other creatures to hurt. Smaller animals are scarcely worth the trouble to these hideous monsters, who prefer to attack humans or other intelligent creatures.</p>
					<p>Gargoyles often collect treasure from human victims. Individuals usually have a handful of gold pieces among them, with the bulk of their treasure hidden carefully at their lair, usually buried or under a large stone.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Originally, gargoyles were carved roof spouts, representing grotesque human and animal figures. They were designed in such a way that water flowing down gutters would be thrown away from the wall, so as to prevent stains and erosion. Later, some unknown mage used a powerful enchantment to bring these horrid sculptures to life. The race of gargoyles has flourished, spreading throughout the world.</p>
					<p>Gargoyles do not need to eat or drink, so they can stand motionless for as long as they wish almost anywhere. The damage they do to other creatures is not for sustenance, but only for their distorted sense of pleasure.</p>
					<p>Because they are fairly intelligent and evil, they will sometimes serve an evil master of some sort. In this case, the gargoyles usually act as guards or messengers; besides some gold or a few gems, their unsavory payment is the enjoyment they get from attacking unwanted visitors.</p>
					<p>The horn of the gargoyle is the more common active ingredient for a <i>potion of invulnerability </i>and can also be used in a <i>potion of flying </i>.</p>
					<p><b>Kapoacinth</b></p>
					<p>This creature is a marine variety of gargoyle that uses its wings to swim as fast as the land-dwelling gargoyle flies. Kapoacinth conform in all respects to a normal gargoyle. They dwell in relatively shallow waters, lairing in undersea caves.</p>
					<p>Like gargoyles, kapoacinth are eager to cause pain to others, and mermen, sea elves, and human visitors are all equally qualified candidates for this.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Margoyle</b></p>
					<p>Margoyles are a more horrid form of gargoyle. They are found mainly in caves and caverns. Their skin is so like stone that they are only 20% likely to be seen when against it. They attack with two claws, a pair of horns, and a bite. They speak their own language and that of gargoyles. They are 20% likely to be found with the latter, either as leaders or masters.</p>

					<p>The oozes, slimes and jellies of the underworld are hideous, amorphous creatures that are the bane of all that lives, dissolving the weapons, armor, and flesh of their victims.</p>
					<p><b></b></p>
					<p><b>Gelatinous Cube</b></p>
					<p>So nearly transparent that they are difficult to see, these cubes travel down dungeon corridors, absorbing carrion and trash along the way. Their sides glisten, tending to leave a slimy trail, but gelatinous cubes cannot climb walls or cling to ceilings. Very large cubes grow tall to garner mosses and the like from ceilings.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>A gelatinous cube attacks by touching its victim with its anesthetizing slime. <b><u>A victim who fails to save vs. paralyzation is paralyzed (anesthetized) for 5-20 (5d4) rounds </u></b>. The cube then surrounds its prey and secretes digestive fluids to absorb the food. All damage is caused by these digestive acids. Because gelatinous cubes are difficult to see, <b>others are -3 on their surprise roll </b>. Electricity, <i>fear </i>, <i>holds </i>, paralyzation, <i>polymorph </i>, and sleep-based attacks have no effect on this monster, but fire and blows from weapons have normal effects. If a cube fails its saving throw against a cold-based attack, the cube will be slowed 50% and inflicts only <b>1-4 points of damage </b>.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Possessing no intelligence, gelatinous cubes live only for eating. They prefer well- traveled dungeons where there is always food to scavenge. These creatures reproduce by budding, leaving clear, rubbery cubes in dark corners or on heaps of trash. Young are not protected and are sometimes reabsorbed by the parent. Treasure is sometimes swept up by a gelatinous cube as the creature travels along a cavern floor; any metals, gems, or jewelry are carried in the monster's body until they can be ejected as indigestible. Items found inside a cube include treasure types J, K, L, M, N, Q, as well as an occasional potion, dagger, or similar object.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>The gelatinous cube is sometimes encouraged to stay in a certain area for its scavenging abilities, and is preferred over other jellies and oozes since its square shape does not allow it to slither under doors and into areas in which it is not desired.</p>

					<p>Genies come from the elemental planes. There, among their own kind, they are have their own societies. Genies are sometimes encountered on the Prime Material plane and are often summoned specifically to perform some service for a powerful wizard or priest. All genies can travel to any of the elemental planes, as well as the Prime Material and Astral planes. Genies speak their own tongue and that of any intelligent beings they meet through a limited form of telepathy.</p>
					<p><b>Djinni</b></p>
					<p>The djinn are genies from the elemental plane of Air. It should be noted that 'djinn' is the plural form of their name, while 'djinni' is the singular.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>The djinn's magical nature enables them to do any of the following once per day: <i>create nutritious food </i>for 2d6 persons and <i>create water </i>or <i>create wine </i>for 2d6 persons; <i>create soft goods </i>(up to 16 cubic feet) or <i>create wooden items </i>(up to 9 cubic feet) of a permanent nature; <i>create metal </i>, up to 100 pounds weight with a short life span (the harder the metal the less time it lasts; gold has about a 24 hour existence while djinni steel lasts only one hour); <i>create illusion </i>as a 20th-level wizard with both visible and audible components, which last without concentration until touched or magically dispelled; use <i>invisibility </i>, <i>gaseous form </i>, or <i>wind walk </i>.</p>
					<p>Once per day, the genie can create a <i>whirlwind </i>, which the it can ride or even direct at will from a distance. The whirlwind is a cone-shaped spiral, measuring up to 10 feet across at its base, 40 feet across at the top, and up to 70 feet in height (the djinni chooses the dimensions). Its maximum speed is 18, with maneuverability class A. The whirlwind's base must touch water or a solid surface, or it will dissolve. It takes a full turn for the whirlwind to form or dissolve. During that time, the whirlwind inflicts no damage and has no other effect. The whirlwind lasts as long as the djinni concentrates on it, moving at the creature's whim. <b><u>If the whirlwind strikes a non-aerial creature with fewer than 2 Hit Dice, the creature must make a saving throw vs. breath weapon for each round of contact with the whirlwind, or be swept off its feet, battered, and killed </u></b>. Hardier beings, as well as aerial or airborne creatures, take <b>2d6 points of damage </b>per round of contact with the whirlwind.</p>
					<p>A djinni can ride its whirlwind and even take along passengers, who (like the djinni) suffer no damage from the buffeting winds. The whirlwind can carry the genie and up to six man-sized or three genie-sized companions.</p>
					<p>Airborne creatures or attacks receive a -1 penalty to attack and damage rolls against a djinni, who also receives a +4 bonus to saving throws against gas attacks and air-based spells.</p>
					<p>Djinn are nearly impossible to capture by physical means; a djinni who is overmatched in combat usually takes to flight and uses its whirlwind to buffet those who follow. Genies are openly contemptuous of those life forms that need wings or artificial means to fly and use illusion and invisibility against such enemies. Thus, the capture and enslavement of djinn is better resolved by the DM on a case-by-case basis. It is worth noting, however, that a good master will typically encourage a djinni to additional effort and higher performance, while a demanding and cruel master encourages the opposite.</p>
					<p>Djinn are able to carry up to 600 pounds, on foot or flying, without tiring. They can carry double that for a short time: three turns if on foot, or one turn if flying. For each 100 pounds below the maximum, add one turn to the time a djinni may walk or fly before tiring. A fatigued djinni must rest for an hour before performing any additional strenuous activity.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>The djinn's native land is the elemental plane of Air, where they live on floating islands of earth and rock, anywhere from 1,000 yards to several miles across. They are crammed with buildings, courtyards, gardens, fountains, and sculptures made of elemental flames. In a typical djinn landhold there are 3dl0 djinn of various ages and powers, as well as 1d10 jann and 1d10 elemental creatures of low intelligence. All are ruled by the local sheik, a djinn of maximum hit points.</p>
					<p>The social structure of Djinn society is based on rule by a caliph, served by various nobles and officials (viziers, beys, emirs, sheiks, sheriffs, and maliks). A caliph rules all the djinn estates within two days' travel, and is advised by six viziers who help maintain the balance of the landholdings. If a landhold is attacked by a large force, a messenger (usually the youngest djinni) is sent to the next landhold, which sends aid and dispatches two more messengers to warn the next landholds; in this fashion the entire nation is warned.</p>
					<p><b>Noble Djinn</b></p>
					<p>Some djinn (1%) are 'noble' and are able to grant three wishes to their masters. Noble djinn perform no other services and, upon granting the third wish are freed of their servitude. Noble djinn are as strong as efreet, with 10 Hit Dice. They strike for <b>3d8 points of damage </b>, and the whirlwinds they create cause 3d6 hit points of damage.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Dao</b></p>
					<p>A dao is a genie from the elemental plane of Earth. While they are generally found on that plane (though even there they are uncommon), the dao love to come to the Prime Material plane to work evil. Dao speak all of the languages of the genies, as well as Common and the tongue of earth elementals.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>The dao's magical abilities enable them to use any of the following magical powers, one at a time, once each per day: <i>change self </i>, <i>detect good </i>, <i>detect magic </i>, <i>gaseous form </i>, <i>invisibility </i>, <i>misdirection </i>, <i>passwall </i>, <i>spectral force </i>, and <i>wall of stone </i>. They can also fulfill another's <i>limited wish </i>(in a perverse way) once each day. Dao can use <i>rock to mud </i>three times per day and <i>dig </i>six times per day. Dao perform all magic as 18th-level spellcasters.</p>
					<p>A dao can carry up to 500 pounds without tiring. Double weight will cause tiring in three turns, but for every 100 pounds of weight under 1,000, the dao may add one turn to the duration of its carrying ability. After tiring, a dao must rest for one hour. Dao can move through earth (not worked stone) at a burrowing speed of 6. They cannot take living beings with them, but can safely carry inanimate objects.</p>
					<p>Dao are not harmed by earth-related spells, but holy water has twice its normal effect upon these monsters.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>The dao dwell in the Great Dismal Delve on their own plane and in deep caves, caverns, or cysts on the Prime Material plane. Dao settle pockets of elemental matter on their own plane, bending those pockets to their will and desire. A dao mazework contains 4d10 dao, as well as 8d10 elemental and non-elemental slaves. Each mazework is ruled by an ataman or hetman who is advised by a seneschal. The loyalty of a mazework's ataman to the Great Dismal Delve is always questionable, but the seneschals are chosen by the khan of the dao, and their loyalty is to him alone.</p>
					<p>The khan of the dao lives at the center of the great mazework called the Great Dismal Delve. The land within the delve is said to be larger than most Prime Material continents. The Great Dismal Delve is linked to all manner of elemental pockets, so the khan can call forth whatever powers he needs. The population of dao in the delve is unknown, as is the number of slaves that constantly work the tunnels and clear away damage caused by the quakes which frequently shake it.</p>
					<p>Dao dislike servitude as much as efreet and are even more prone to malice and revenge than their fiery counterparts.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>The dao manage a thriving business of trade, driven by a desire for more power and access to precious gems. High on their list of hatreds are most other genies (except efreet, with whom they trade worked metals for minerals). They also have little use for other elemental creatures; the dao value these only if they can exploit them in some fashion.</p>
					<p><b>Efreeti</b></p>
					<p>The efreet (singular: efreeti) are genies from the elemental plane of Fire. They are enemies of the djinn and attack them whenever they are encountered. A properly summoned or captured efreeti can be forced to serve for a maximum of 1,001 days, or it can be made to fulfill three wishes. Efreet are not willing servants and seek to pervert the intent of their masters by adhering to the letter of their commands.</p>
					<p>The efreet are said to be made of basalt, bronze, and solid flames. They are massive, solid creatures.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>An efreeti is able to do the following once per day: grant up to three <i>wishes </i>; use <i>invisibility </i>, <i>gaseous form </i>, <i>detect magic </i>, <i>enlarge </i>, <i>polymorph self </i>, and <i>wall of fire </i>; create an illusion with both visual and audio components which will last without concentration until magically dispelled or touched. An efreeti can also produce flame or use pyrotechnics at will. Efreet are <b><u>immune to normal fire-based attacks, and even an attack with magical fire suffers a -1 penalty on all attack and damage rolls </u></b>.</p>
					<p>Efreet can carry up to 750 pounds on foot or flying, without tiring. They can also carry double weight for a limited time: three turns on foot or one turn aloft. For each 150 pounds of weight under 1500, add one turn to either walking or flying time permitted. After tiring, the efreeti must rest for one hour.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Efreet are infamous for their hatred of servitude, desire for revenge, cruel nature, and ability to beguile and mislead. The efreet's primary home is their great citadel, the fabled City of Brass, but there are many other efreet outposts throughout the plane of Fire.</p>
					<p>An efreet outpost is a haven for 4d10 efreet and is run as a military station to watch or harass others in the plane. These outposts are run by a malik or vali of maximum normal hit points. There is a 10% chance that the outpost is also providing a temporary home for 1d4 jann or 1d4 dao (the only other genies efreet tolerate). Outpost forces are usually directed against incursions from the elemental plane of Air, but they can be directed against any travelers deemed suitable for threats, robbery, and abuse.</p>
					<p>Efreet are neutral, but tend toward organized evil. They are ruled by a grand sultan who makes his home in the City of Brass. He is advised by a variety of beys, amirs, and maliks concerning actions within the plane, and by six great pashas who deal with efreet business on the Prime Material plane.</p>
					<p>The City of Brass is a huge citadel that is home to the majority of efreet. It hovers in the hot regions of the plane and is often bordered by seas of magma and lakes of glowing lava. The city sits upon a hemisphere of golden, glowing brass some 40 miles across. From the upper towers rise the minarets of the great bastion of the Sultan's Palace. Vast riches are said to be in the palace of the sultan. The city has an efreet population that far outnumbers the great cities of the Prime Material plane. The sultan wields the might of a Greater Power, while many of his advisors are akin to Lesser Powers and Demi-Powers.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Fire elementals tend to avoid the efreet, whom they feel are oppressive and opportunistic. Djinn hate them, and there have been numerous djinn-efreet clashes. Efreet view most other creatures either as enemies or servants, a view that does not endear them to other genies.</p>
					<p><b>Marid</b></p>
					<p>The marids are said to be born of the ocean, having currents for muscles and pearls for teeth. These genies from the elemental plane of Water are the most powerful of all genies. They are also the most individualistic and chaotic of the elemental races, and only rarely deign to serve others.</p>
					<p>On their own plane they are rare; marids travel so seldom to the Prime Material plane that many consider marids to be creatures of legend only.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Marids perform as 26th-level spellcasters, and can use any of the following magical powers, one at a time, twice each per day: <i>detect evil </i>, <i>detect good </i>, <i>detect invisibility </i>, <i>detect magic </i>, <i>invisibility </i>, <i>liquid form </i>(similar to <i>gaseous form </i>), <i>polymorph self </i>, and <i>purify water </i>. Marids can use any of the following up to seven times per day: <i>gaseous form </i>, <i>lower water </i>, <i>part water </i>, <i>wall of fog </i>, or <i>water breathing </i>(used on others, lasting up to one full day). Once per year a marid can use <i>alter reality </i>.</p>
					<p>Marids can always <i>create water </i>, which they may direct in a powerful jet up to 60 yards long. <b><u>Victims struck by the jet take 1d6 points of damage </u></b><u>and must make a successful saving throw vs. breath weapon or be blinded for 1d6 rounds </u>. Marids also have the innate ability to <i>water walk </i>(as the ring).</p>
					<p>A marid can carry 1,000 pounds. Double weight causes tiring in three turns. For every 200 pounds under 2,000, add one turn to the time the marid can carry before tiring. A tired marid must rest for one hour.</p>
					<p>Marids swim, breathe water, are at home at any depth, and have infravision. They are not harmed by water-based spells. Cold-based spells grant them a +2 bonus to saving throws and -2 to each die of damage. Fire inflicts +1 per die of damage, with saving throws at a -1 penalty. Steam does not harm them.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Marids live in a loose empire ruled by a padisha. Each marid lays some claim to royalty; they are all shahs, atabegs, beglerbegs, or mufti at the very least. There have often been several simultaneous 'single true heirs' to the padisha's throne through the eons.</p>
					<p>A marid household numbers 2d10 and is located around loosely grouped elemental pockets containing the necessities for marid life. Larger groups of marids gather for hunts and tournaments, where individual effort is heavily emphasized.</p>
					<p>Marids are champion tale-tellers, although most of their tales emphasize their own prowess, and belittle others. When communicating with a marid, one must attempt to keep the conversation going without continual digression for one tale or another, while not offending the marid. Marids consider it a capital offense for a lesser being to offend a marid.</p>
					<p>Marids are both fiercely independent and extremely egoistical. They are not easily forced to perform actions; even if convinced through flattery and bribery to obey, they often stray from their intended course to seek some other adventure that promises greater glory, or to instruct lesser creatures on the glories of the marids.</p>
					<p>Most mages skilled in summoning and conjuration consider marids to be more trouble than they are worth, which accounts for the great lack of items of marid control (as opposed to those affecting efreet and djinn). Marids can travel the Ethereal plane, in addition to those planes to which all genies can travel.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Marids tolerate their genie relatives, putting up with jann and djinn like poor cousins, while they have an aversion to efreet and dao. Their attitude toward the rest of the world is similar; most creatures from other planes are considered lesser beings, not fit to be bothered with unless one lands in the feast hall at an inopportune time.</p>
					<p><b>Janni</b></p>
					<p>The jann are the weakest of the elemental humanoids known collectively as genies. Jann are formed out of all four elements and must therefore spend most of their time on the Prime Material plane. In addition to speaking Common and all the languages of genies, jann can speak with animals.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Jann often wear chain mail armor (60% chance), giving them an effective AC of 2. They typically use great scimitars which inflict <b>2d8 damage </b>to small and medium creatures, and <b>4d4 points of damage </b>to larger opponents. They also use composite long bows. Male jann have exceptional Strength scores; roll percentile dice for their Strengths. For female jann, roll percentile dice and subtract 50; anything above 0 indicates percentage Strength equal to that number, while anything below indicates 18 Strength.</p>
					<p>Jann can use one the following magical powers each round: <i>enlarge </i>or <i>reduce </i>, twice each per day; <i>invisibility </i>three times per day; <i>create food and water </i>once per day as a 7th-level priest; and <i>etherealness </i>(as the armor) once per day for a maximum of one hour. Jann perform at 12th-level ability, except as noted.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Jann favor forlorn deserts and hidden oases, where they have both privacy and safety. Jann society is very open, and males and females are regarded as equals. A tribe is made up of 1d20+10 individuals and is ruled by a sheik and one or two viziers. Exceptionally powerful sheiks are given the title of amir, and in times of need they gather and command large forces of jann (and sometimes allied humans).</p>
					<p>Many jann tribes are nomadic, traveling with flocks of camels, goats, or sheep from oasis to oasis. These itinerant jann appear human in every respect, and are often mistaken for them, unless they are attacked. Jann are strong and courageous, and they do not take kindly to insult or injury. The territory of a jann tribe can extend hundreds of miles in any direction.</p>
					<p>While traveling, male jann live in large, colorful tents with their wives and married male children, and their families. Married daughters move away to live with their new husbands. When a family eventually grows large enough that it can no longer reside comfortably in the tent, a new tent is built, and a son takes his wife and family with him to this new dwelling. At permanent oases, the jann live not only in tents, but also in elegantly styled structures built from materials brought from any of the elemental planes.</p>
					<p>Jann are able to dwell in air, earth, fire, or water environments for up to 48 hours. This includes the elemental planes, to which any janni can travel, even taking up to six individuals along if those others hold hands in a circle with the janni. Failure to return to the Prime Material plane within 48 hours inflicts 1 point of damage per additional hour on the jann, until the jann dies or returns to the Prime Material plane. Travel to another elemental plane is possible, without damage, providing at least two days are spent on the Prime Material plane immediately prior to the travel.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Jann are suspicious of humans, dislike demihumans, and detest humanoids. Jann accept djinn, but shun dao, efreet, and marids. They sometimes befriend humans or work with them for a desired reward, like potent magical items.</p>
					<p>One ethic the jann share with other nomads is the cultural demand for treating guests with honor and respect. Innocent visitors (including humans) are treated hospitably during their stay, but some day might be expected to return the favor.</p>
					<p><b>Jann Leaders</b></p>
					<p>Jann leaders have 17-18 Intelligence, and 10% have 19 Strength. Sheiks have up to 8 Hit Dice, amirs up to 9. Viziers have 17-20 Intelligence and the following magical powers, each usable three times per day at 12th-level spellcasting ability: <i>augury </i>, <i>detect magic </i>, and <i>divination </i>.</p>

					<p>Genies come from the elemental planes. There, among their own kind, they are have their own societies. Genies are sometimes encountered on the Prime Material plane and are often summoned specifically to perform some service for a powerful wizard or priest. All genies can travel to any of the elemental planes, as well as the Prime Material and Astral planes. Genies speak their own tongue and that of any intelligent beings they meet through a limited form of telepathy.</p>
					<p><b>Djinni</b></p>
					<p>The djinn are genies from the elemental plane of Air. It should be noted that 'djinn' is the plural form of their name, while 'djinni' is the singular.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>The djinn's magical nature enables them to do any of the following once per day: <i>create nutritious food </i>for 2d6 persons and <i>create water </i>or <i>create wine </i>for 2d6 persons; <i>create soft goods </i>(up to 16 cubic feet) or <i>create wooden items </i>(up to 9 cubic feet) of a permanent nature; <i>create metal </i>, up to 100 pounds weight with a short life span (the harder the metal the less time it lasts; gold has about a 24 hour existence while djinni steel lasts only one hour); <i>create illusion </i>as a 20th-level wizard with both visible and audible components, which last without concentration until touched or magically dispelled; use <i>invisibility </i>, <i>gaseous form </i>, or <i>wind walk </i>.</p>
					<p>Once per day, the genie can create a <i>whirlwind </i>, which the it can ride or even direct at will from a distance. The whirlwind is a cone-shaped spiral, measuring up to 10 feet across at its base, 40 feet across at the top, and up to 70 feet in height (the djinni chooses the dimensions). Its maximum speed is 18, with maneuverability class A. The whirlwind's base must touch water or a solid surface, or it will dissolve. It takes a full turn for the whirlwind to form or dissolve. During that time, the whirlwind inflicts no damage and has no other effect. The whirlwind lasts as long as the djinni concentrates on it, moving at the creature's whim. <b><u>If the whirlwind strikes a non-aerial creature with fewer than 2 Hit Dice, the creature must make a saving throw vs. breath weapon for each round of contact with the whirlwind, or be swept off its feet, battered, and killed </u></b>. Hardier beings, as well as aerial or airborne creatures, take <b>2d6 points of damage </b>per round of contact with the whirlwind.</p>
					<p>A djinni can ride its whirlwind and even take along passengers, who (like the djinni) suffer no damage from the buffeting winds. The whirlwind can carry the genie and up to six man-sized or three genie-sized companions.</p>
					<p>Airborne creatures or attacks receive a -1 penalty to attack and damage rolls against a djinni, who also receives a +4 bonus to saving throws against gas attacks and air-based spells.</p>
					<p>Djinn are nearly impossible to capture by physical means; a djinni who is overmatched in combat usually takes to flight and uses its whirlwind to buffet those who follow. Genies are openly contemptuous of those life forms that need wings or artificial means to fly and use illusion and invisibility against such enemies. Thus, the capture and enslavement of djinn is better resolved by the DM on a case-by-case basis. It is worth noting, however, that a good master will typically encourage a djinni to additional effort and higher performance, while a demanding and cruel master encourages the opposite.</p>
					<p>Djinn are able to carry up to 600 pounds, on foot or flying, without tiring. They can carry double that for a short time: three turns if on foot, or one turn if flying. For each 100 pounds below the maximum, add one turn to the time a djinni may walk or fly before tiring. A fatigued djinni must rest for an hour before performing any additional strenuous activity.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>The djinn's native land is the elemental plane of Air, where they live on floating islands of earth and rock, anywhere from 1,000 yards to several miles across. They are crammed with buildings, courtyards, gardens, fountains, and sculptures made of elemental flames. In a typical djinn landhold there are 3dl0 djinn of various ages and powers, as well as 1d10 jann and 1d10 elemental creatures of low intelligence. All are ruled by the local sheik, a djinn of maximum hit points.</p>
					<p>The social structure of Djinn society is based on rule by a caliph, served by various nobles and officials (viziers, beys, emirs, sheiks, sheriffs, and maliks). A caliph rules all the djinn estates within two days' travel, and is advised by six viziers who help maintain the balance of the landholdings. If a landhold is attacked by a large force, a messenger (usually the youngest djinni) is sent to the next landhold, which sends aid and dispatches two more messengers to warn the next landholds; in this fashion the entire nation is warned.</p>
					<p><b>Noble Djinn</b></p>
					<p>Some djinn (1%) are 'noble' and are able to grant three wishes to their masters. Noble djinn perform no other services and, upon granting the third wish are freed of their servitude. Noble djinn are as strong as efreet, with 10 Hit Dice. They strike for <b>3d8 points of damage </b>, and the whirlwinds they create cause 3d6 hit points of damage.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Dao</b></p>
					<p>A dao is a genie from the elemental plane of Earth. While they are generally found on that plane (though even there they are uncommon), the dao love to come to the Prime Material plane to work evil. Dao speak all of the languages of the genies, as well as Common and the tongue of earth elementals.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>The dao's magical abilities enable them to use any of the following magical powers, one at a time, once each per day: <i>change self </i>, <i>detect good </i>, <i>detect magic </i>, <i>gaseous form </i>, <i>invisibility </i>, <i>misdirection </i>, <i>passwall </i>, <i>spectral force </i>, and <i>wall of stone </i>. They can also fulfill another's <i>limited wish </i>(in a perverse way) once each day. Dao can use <i>rock to mud </i>three times per day and <i>dig </i>six times per day. Dao perform all magic as 18th-level spellcasters.</p>
					<p>A dao can carry up to 500 pounds without tiring. Double weight will cause tiring in three turns, but for every 100 pounds of weight under 1,000, the dao may add one turn to the duration of its carrying ability. After tiring, a dao must rest for one hour. Dao can move through earth (not worked stone) at a burrowing speed of 6. They cannot take living beings with them, but can safely carry inanimate objects.</p>
					<p>Dao are not harmed by earth-related spells, but holy water has twice its normal effect upon these monsters.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>The dao dwell in the Great Dismal Delve on their own plane and in deep caves, caverns, or cysts on the Prime Material plane. Dao settle pockets of elemental matter on their own plane, bending those pockets to their will and desire. A dao mazework contains 4d10 dao, as well as 8d10 elemental and non-elemental slaves. Each mazework is ruled by an ataman or hetman who is advised by a seneschal. The loyalty of a mazework's ataman to the Great Dismal Delve is always questionable, but the seneschals are chosen by the khan of the dao, and their loyalty is to him alone.</p>
					<p>The khan of the dao lives at the center of the great mazework called the Great Dismal Delve. The land within the delve is said to be larger than most Prime Material continents. The Great Dismal Delve is linked to all manner of elemental pockets, so the khan can call forth whatever powers he needs. The population of dao in the delve is unknown, as is the number of slaves that constantly work the tunnels and clear away damage caused by the quakes which frequently shake it.</p>
					<p>Dao dislike servitude as much as efreet and are even more prone to malice and revenge than their fiery counterparts.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>The dao manage a thriving business of trade, driven by a desire for more power and access to precious gems. High on their list of hatreds are most other genies (except efreet, with whom they trade worked metals for minerals). They also have little use for other elemental creatures; the dao value these only if they can exploit them in some fashion.</p>
					<p><b>Efreeti</b></p>
					<p>The efreet (singular: efreeti) are genies from the elemental plane of Fire. They are enemies of the djinn and attack them whenever they are encountered. A properly summoned or captured efreeti can be forced to serve for a maximum of 1,001 days, or it can be made to fulfill three wishes. Efreet are not willing servants and seek to pervert the intent of their masters by adhering to the letter of their commands.</p>
					<p>The efreet are said to be made of basalt, bronze, and solid flames. They are massive, solid creatures.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>An efreeti is able to do the following once per day: grant up to three <i>wishes </i>; use <i>invisibility </i>, <i>gaseous form </i>, <i>detect magic </i>, <i>enlarge </i>, <i>polymorph self </i>, and <i>wall of fire </i>; create an illusion with both visual and audio components which will last without concentration until magically dispelled or touched. An efreeti can also produce flame or use pyrotechnics at will. Efreet are <b><u>immune to normal fire-based attacks, and even an attack with magical fire suffers a -1 penalty on all attack and damage rolls </u></b>.</p>
					<p>Efreet can carry up to 750 pounds on foot or flying, without tiring. They can also carry double weight for a limited time: three turns on foot or one turn aloft. For each 150 pounds of weight under 1500, add one turn to either walking or flying time permitted. After tiring, the efreeti must rest for one hour.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Efreet are infamous for their hatred of servitude, desire for revenge, cruel nature, and ability to beguile and mislead. The efreet's primary home is their great citadel, the fabled City of Brass, but there are many other efreet outposts throughout the plane of Fire.</p>
					<p>An efreet outpost is a haven for 4d10 efreet and is run as a military station to watch or harass others in the plane. These outposts are run by a malik or vali of maximum normal hit points. There is a 10% chance that the outpost is also providing a temporary home for 1d4 jann or 1d4 dao (the only other genies efreet tolerate). Outpost forces are usually directed against incursions from the elemental plane of Air, but they can be directed against any travelers deemed suitable for threats, robbery, and abuse.</p>
					<p>Efreet are neutral, but tend toward organized evil. They are ruled by a grand sultan who makes his home in the City of Brass. He is advised by a variety of beys, amirs, and maliks concerning actions within the plane, and by six great pashas who deal with efreet business on the Prime Material plane.</p>
					<p>The City of Brass is a huge citadel that is home to the majority of efreet. It hovers in the hot regions of the plane and is often bordered by seas of magma and lakes of glowing lava. The city sits upon a hemisphere of golden, glowing brass some 40 miles across. From the upper towers rise the minarets of the great bastion of the Sultan's Palace. Vast riches are said to be in the palace of the sultan. The city has an efreet population that far outnumbers the great cities of the Prime Material plane. The sultan wields the might of a Greater Power, while many of his advisors are akin to Lesser Powers and Demi-Powers.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Fire elementals tend to avoid the efreet, whom they feel are oppressive and opportunistic. Djinn hate them, and there have been numerous djinn-efreet clashes. Efreet view most other creatures either as enemies or servants, a view that does not endear them to other genies.</p>
					<p><b>Marid</b></p>
					<p>The marids are said to be born of the ocean, having currents for muscles and pearls for teeth. These genies from the elemental plane of Water are the most powerful of all genies. They are also the most individualistic and chaotic of the elemental races, and only rarely deign to serve others.</p>
					<p>On their own plane they are rare; marids travel so seldom to the Prime Material plane that many consider marids to be creatures of legend only.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Marids perform as 26th-level spellcasters, and can use any of the following magical powers, one at a time, twice each per day: <i>detect evil </i>, <i>detect good </i>, <i>detect invisibility </i>, <i>detect magic </i>, <i>invisibility </i>, <i>liquid form </i>(similar to <i>gaseous form </i>), <i>polymorph self </i>, and <i>purify water </i>. Marids can use any of the following up to seven times per day: <i>gaseous form </i>, <i>lower water </i>, <i>part water </i>, <i>wall of fog </i>, or <i>water breathing </i>(used on others, lasting up to one full day). Once per year a marid can use <i>alter reality </i>.</p>
					<p>Marids can always <i>create water </i>, which they may direct in a powerful jet up to 60 yards long. <b><u>Victims struck by the jet take 1d6 points of damage </u></b><u>and must make a successful saving throw vs. breath weapon or be blinded for 1d6 rounds </u>. Marids also have the innate ability to <i>water walk </i>(as the ring).</p>
					<p>A marid can carry 1,000 pounds. Double weight causes tiring in three turns. For every 200 pounds under 2,000, add one turn to the time the marid can carry before tiring. A tired marid must rest for one hour.</p>
					<p>Marids swim, breathe water, are at home at any depth, and have infravision. They are not harmed by water-based spells. Cold-based spells grant them a +2 bonus to saving throws and -2 to each die of damage. Fire inflicts +1 per die of damage, with saving throws at a -1 penalty. Steam does not harm them.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Marids live in a loose empire ruled by a padisha. Each marid lays some claim to royalty; they are all shahs, atabegs, beglerbegs, or mufti at the very least. There have often been several simultaneous 'single true heirs' to the padisha's throne through the eons.</p>
					<p>A marid household numbers 2d10 and is located around loosely grouped elemental pockets containing the necessities for marid life. Larger groups of marids gather for hunts and tournaments, where individual effort is heavily emphasized.</p>
					<p>Marids are champion tale-tellers, although most of their tales emphasize their own prowess, and belittle others. When communicating with a marid, one must attempt to keep the conversation going without continual digression for one tale or another, while not offending the marid. Marids consider it a capital offense for a lesser being to offend a marid.</p>
					<p>Marids are both fiercely independent and extremely egoistical. They are not easily forced to perform actions; even if convinced through flattery and bribery to obey, they often stray from their intended course to seek some other adventure that promises greater glory, or to instruct lesser creatures on the glories of the marids.</p>
					<p>Most mages skilled in summoning and conjuration consider marids to be more trouble than they are worth, which accounts for the great lack of items of marid control (as opposed to those affecting efreet and djinn). Marids can travel the Ethereal plane, in addition to those planes to which all genies can travel.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Marids tolerate their genie relatives, putting up with jann and djinn like poor cousins, while they have an aversion to efreet and dao. Their attitude toward the rest of the world is similar; most creatures from other planes are considered lesser beings, not fit to be bothered with unless one lands in the feast hall at an inopportune time.</p>
					<p><b>Janni</b></p>
					<p>The jann are the weakest of the elemental humanoids known collectively as genies. Jann are formed out of all four elements and must therefore spend most of their time on the Prime Material plane. In addition to speaking Common and all the languages of genies, jann can speak with animals.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Jann often wear chain mail armor (60% chance), giving them an effective AC of 2. They typically use great scimitars which inflict <b>2d8 damage </b>to small and medium creatures, and <b>4d4 points of damage </b>to larger opponents. They also use composite long bows. Male jann have exceptional Strength scores; roll percentile dice for their Strengths. For female jann, roll percentile dice and subtract 50; anything above 0 indicates percentage Strength equal to that number, while anything below indicates 18 Strength.</p>
					<p>Jann can use one the following magical powers each round: <i>enlarge </i>or <i>reduce </i>, twice each per day; <i>invisibility </i>three times per day; <i>create food and water </i>once per day as a 7th-level priest; and <i>etherealness </i>(as the armor) once per day for a maximum of one hour. Jann perform at 12th-level ability, except as noted.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Jann favor forlorn deserts and hidden oases, where they have both privacy and safety. Jann society is very open, and males and females are regarded as equals. A tribe is made up of 1d20+10 individuals and is ruled by a sheik and one or two viziers. Exceptionally powerful sheiks are given the title of amir, and in times of need they gather and command large forces of jann (and sometimes allied humans).</p>
					<p>Many jann tribes are nomadic, traveling with flocks of camels, goats, or sheep from oasis to oasis. These itinerant jann appear human in every respect, and are often mistaken for them, unless they are attacked. Jann are strong and courageous, and they do not take kindly to insult or injury. The territory of a jann tribe can extend hundreds of miles in any direction.</p>
					<p>While traveling, male jann live in large, colorful tents with their wives and married male children, and their families. Married daughters move away to live with their new husbands. When a family eventually grows large enough that it can no longer reside comfortably in the tent, a new tent is built, and a son takes his wife and family with him to this new dwelling. At permanent oases, the jann live not only in tents, but also in elegantly styled structures built from materials brought from any of the elemental planes.</p>
					<p>Jann are able to dwell in air, earth, fire, or water environments for up to 48 hours. This includes the elemental planes, to which any janni can travel, even taking up to six individuals along if those others hold hands in a circle with the janni. Failure to return to the Prime Material plane within 48 hours inflicts 1 point of damage per additional hour on the jann, until the jann dies or returns to the Prime Material plane. Travel to another elemental plane is possible, without damage, providing at least two days are spent on the Prime Material plane immediately prior to the travel.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Jann are suspicious of humans, dislike demihumans, and detest humanoids. Jann accept djinn, but shun dao, efreet, and marids. They sometimes befriend humans or work with them for a desired reward, like potent magical items.</p>
					<p>One ethic the jann share with other nomads is the cultural demand for treating guests with honor and respect. Innocent visitors (including humans) are treated hospitably during their stay, but some day might be expected to return the favor.</p>
					<p><b>Jann Leaders</b></p>
					<p>Jann leaders have 17-18 Intelligence, and 10% have 19 Strength. Sheiks have up to 8 Hit Dice, amirs up to 9. Viziers have 17-20 Intelligence and the following magical powers, each usable three times per day at 12th-level spellcasting ability: <i>augury </i>, <i>detect magic </i>, and <i>divination </i>.</p>

					<p>Noble djinn are the rulers of all genies on the Elemental Plane of Air, and they are masters of the province of wind. They can speak their own tongue and that of any intelligent creature they meet through a limited form of telepathy. They never forget either a service or a slight from another creature.</p>
					<p>Noble djinn pride themselves on being the tallest and fairest of their kind. They enjoy wearing jewelry and rich clothes to distinguish themselves even further from common djinn. They prefer loose, lightweight silks and cottons.</p>
					<p>On their home plane, noble djinn are always accompanied by processions of 4-40 common djinn who are their courtiers, soldiers, fan-bearers, minstrels, grooms, and servants. On the Prime Material Plane, noble djinn are always carried by either an animal (such as an elephant or camel) or in a rich palanquin by four servants. Under no circumstances will they allow their feet to touch the ground. Ideally, of course, djinn nobles travel by air under their own power, but often wind and weather or the need to enter a city in grand style dictate that they travel near the ground. Noble djinn sneer at life forms unable to fly naturally and will generally hover over earthbound nobles of other races to make their point.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>The noble djinn can create nutritious food for 4-24 people, create water or wine for 4-24 persons, create soft goods, including nonmagical cloth, wood, brass, copper, or tin items (up to 25, 16, and 9 cubic feet of each) with permanence, create iron, gold, platinum, and silver items of short life span (about 24 hours), create illusions with visual, thermal, audible, and tactile components which last without concentration until dispelled, become invisible, assume gaseous form, windwalk, or form a whirlwind. In their gaseous form, noble djinn resemble clouds. In addition, a noble djinni may cast <i>gust of wind </i>at will, <i>cloudkill </i>once per day, <i>control weather </i>once per week, and <i>airwalk </i>on up to seven other creatures once per day. Once per year, a noble djinni can cast <i>windtomb </i>. All noble djinn magic is cast as if at the 20th level of ability.</p>
					<p>Noble djinn can grant three wishes to their masters, but if they are forced to grant such wishes they will undertake no other service; they are freed of their servitude upon granting the third wish. These wishes are only granted to creatures from the Prime Material Plane.</p>
					<p>A noble djinni's whirlwind is a funnel 20' across at its base, 60' across at its top, and 100' high. It requires five rounds to form and five rounds to fully dissolve. It lasts for as long as the noble djinni concentrates on it. Nonaerial creatures of less than three Hit Dice are swept away and killed by the whirlwind while hardier beings take 3-18 (3d6) points of damage. This whirlwind may also carry up to 15 man-sized creatures or 6 djinn- or jannsized creatures, which may be protected from harm by the genie's will. Whether carried creatures are harmed by the whirlwind or not, they can be transported at a movement rate of 21 and a maneuverability class of B as long as the noble djinni's concentration is not disturbed.</p>
					<p>Air-based attacks are utterly useless against noble djinn, including poison gases, gaseous breath weapons, <i>cloudkill </i>, <i>wind control </i>, and all elemental air spells.</p>
					<p>Noble djinn are too intelligent and too powerful to be captured by physical means. Magically enslaved noble djinn will refuse to extend their abilities to the fullest for their masters unless they are constantly deferred to in matters of opinion (though they will still obey orders), given slaves of their own to replace the ones they no longer have at their disposal, and generally treated as equals or even superiors.</p>
					<p>A noble djinni can carry up to 2,000 pounds either afoot or flying without a penalty to movement, though they consider such work beneath them. They can carry double that weight for three turns afoot or a single turn while flying. (For each 200 pounds less than the maximum, add one turn to the time before tiring.) A fatigued noble djinni must rest for six turns before attempting further strenuous activity.</p>
					<p>Noble djinn rarely allow themselves to be drawn into direct combat with opposing forces, preferring to command common djinn or summoned creatures to fight for them while casting spells and giving orders. If possible, noble djinn will use their illusion and invisibility spell-like abilities to avoid combat altogether, and under no circumstances will they do combat in an unfavorable elemental environment, such as underground.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Noble djinn are of two types. Most are local caliphs, sheiks, sherrifs, and maliks who rule over a small number of landholders. These noble djinn command small groups of djinn scattered throughout the Plane of Air. A typical local ruler commands 1-6 households, each of which consists of 3-30 djinn, 1-10 jann servants, and 1-10 elemental creatures of low intelligence. The local sheik or headman of each of these holdings is a djinn of maximum hit points. In general, noble djinn who dwell and rule on the Prime Material Plane command only a single household. Female noble djinn take part as leaders of their people, and they have more freedom than the common djinn.</p>
					<p>Any holding attacked by a large or dangerous force sends messengers cloaked by <i>invisibility </i>to the nearest two holdings, which each send two more messengers, until the entire djinn nation is warned. Some noble djinn also raise homing pigeons and other flying animals to accomplish the same end. Other nobles have raised falconry and the husbandry of fancy talking birds, tumblers, pouters, and other unusual breeds to a fine art.</p>
					<p>A smaller but more influential group of noble djinn spends its time at the court of the Great Caliph of the Djinn, known as the Court of Ice and Steel. This rich palace is carved from a huge glacial rock which perpetually hurtles through the gulf of Elemental Air, creating a permanent rush of wind throughout the court. The chambers of the court are secured by steel portals set deep into the ice, and the air is only still in any one of the Court's rooms when all the portals to that room are shut. Whenever the portals open, a blast of wind stirs the curtains, banners, and clouds of incense throughout the room. Illumination comes from flickering orange lanterns or from the blue light that filters in as it refracts through the glacial ice. Most chambers are only accessible to flying creatures, as there are no stairs, and hallways are just as likely to be vertical shafts as horizontal ones. Visiting creatures not native to the Plane of Elemental Air are usually escorted everywhere to ensure their safety, and to allow the Great Caliph of the Djinn to keep an eye on them.</p>
					<p>The noble djinn of the Court of Ice and Steel are the viziers, beys, and emirs. They only leave the premises when they are commanded to assume the onerous duties of rulership over groups of djinn elsewhere or when compelled to answer the summons of a powerful sha'ir.</p>
					<p>Noble djinn are rarely pleased to serve even the most powerful of human wizards, and if the servitude drags on for months they may complain bitterly of the duties they are neglecting by serving a human. Noble djinn who are mistreated and who make their way back to their estates will return with half their subjects to avenge their honor.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Noble djinn require very little from other creatures, as their djinn subjects provide them with all the necessities of life. However, their constant rivalry both among themselves and with other noble genies leads them to strive for the richest gems, jewelry, cloth, spices, and perfume they can obtain. Often manners and ethics are no obstacle to a noble djinni on the trail of something unique. Noble djinn will sometimes send their servant creatures to obtain these sorts of riches from the Prime Material Plane.</p>
					<p>Noble djinn hate the efreet and will cooperate in any attempt to harm them. Despite their haughtiness, noble djinn respect individual achievements and will cooperate with other creatures of the Elemental Plane of Air rather than attempting to enslave them. Their servants are retainers who may leave at any time, but stay because they consider it an honor to serve. From time to time, a particularly driven noble djinni will undertake either a raid or a crusade against the dao or efreet and seek to free slaves and embarrass opposing nobles. Since those genies are generally more powerful than noble djinn, these expeditions are rare.</p>
					<p><b>Great Caliph of the Djinn</b></p>
					<p>The ruler of the djinn is known by a long list of titles including, but not limited to, the Commander of the Four Winds, Ruler of all Djinn, Defender of the Heavens, Prince of Birds, Storm of the Righteous, and Master of the Air. He is always attended by his courtiers, who number 4-20 noble djinn (half of whom are his dancers and consorts), 40-400 jann, and 10-100 common djinn at any given time. The Great Caliph of the Djinn rarely leaves the Court of Ice and Steel; he is perpetually called upon to decide matters of state, matters of law, and matters of politics among his nobles. When he does leave, it is generally with an entourage of nobles to go hunting elemental creatures, though occasionally they go to the lands of Zakhara to stir up trouble among the cities there.</p>
					<p>Infrequently, the Great Caliph will demand a procession be held (in his honor or to celebrate the anointment of a new noble djinn or a noble marriage). These processions are grand affairs involving at least 50 noble djinn, 100-1,000 common djinn, and clouds of banners, flags, and streamers. The course of a procession often takes it in loops, rolls, and dives, and its meandering path often tours the Plane of Elemental Air for days or weeks.</p>
					<p>The Great Caliph has 15+6 Hit Dice and maximum hit points for a noble djinn. In addition to having all the usual powers of a noble djinn, the caliph has access to all spells of the province of wind magic once per day. He is always surrounded by a gentle breeze, which stirs his hair and flowing garments. All hurled and ranged missile weapons are ineffective against him, as the winds protect him, acting as permanent <i>protection from normal missiles </i>and <i>protection from magical missiles </i>spells.</p>
					<p>The Great Caliph of the Djinn is fickle and easily bored, but this by no means indicates that he is soft or unable to rule. When required, he can rouse genie armies to victory and can wrestle monsters into submission. In general, however, the caliph prefers to win his battles by his wits rather than by the strength of his armies or his magic. Since the efreet that often harass the djinn are individually stronger than the djinn, this tactic is common among lesser djinn as well.</p>
					<p>The court chamber itself is at the center of the Court of Ice and Steel, with clear shafts running to the outer surfaces in all directions. Creatures who (willingly or unwillingly) gain an audience with the Grand Caliph are brought to hover before him. If they cannot fly under their own power, they are buffeted by the whirlwinds of their djinn guards for <b>3d6 points of damage </b>each round. Presenting oneself as earthbound before the Great Caliph can be exhausting. The chamber of the court itself seems to be in perpetual motion, as layers of silk streamers constantly flutter in and out. In dealing with creatures not from the Plane of Elemental Air, the Great Caliph is inclined to be merciful and often ends his recitation and judgment within a matter of a few minutes.</p>
					<p>When traveling to the Prime Material Plane, the arrival of the Great Caliph of the Djinn is always signaled by a great blast of wind. Once there, he often travels in a procession like that of noble djinni, only of twice the usual size.</p>

					<p>Ghosts are the spirits of humans who were either so greatly evil in life or whose deaths were so unusually emotional they have been cursed with the gift of undead status. Thus, they roam about at night or in places of darkness. These spirits hate goodness and life, hungering to draw the living essences from the living.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>As ghosts are non-corporeal (ethereal), they are usually encountered only by creatures in a like state, although they can be seen by non-ethereal creatures. <b><u>The supernatural power of a ghost is such, however, that the mere sight of one causes any humanoid being to age 10 years and flee in panic for 2-12 (2d6) turns unless a saving throw versus spell is made </u></b>. Priests above 6th level are <b><u>immune to this effect, and all other humanoids above 8th level may add +2 to their saving throws </u></b>.</p>
					<p>Any creatures within 60 yards of a ghost is subject to attack by <i>magic jar </i>. If the ghost fails to <i>magic jar </i>its chosen victim, it will then semi-materialize in order to attack by touch (in which case the ghost is Armor Class 0). Semi-materialized ghosts can be struck only by silver (half damage) or magical weapons (full damage). If they strike an opponent it ages him 10-40 (1d4x10) years. Note that ghosts can be attacked with spells only by creatures who are in an ethereal state. Any human or demi-human killed by a ghost is drained of its life essence and is forever dead.</p>
					<p>If the ghost fails to become semi-material it can only be combatted by another in the Ethereal plane (in which case the ghost has an Armor Class of 8).</p>
					<p>Ghosts can be turned by clerics after reaching 7th level and can be damaged by holy water while in their semi-material form.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>In most cases, a ghost is confined to a small physical area, which the ghost haunts. Those who have heard stories of a haunted area can thus attempt to avoid it for their own safety.</p>
					<p>A ghost often has a specific purpose in its haunting, sometimes trying to 'get even' for something that happened during the ghost's life. Thus a woman who was jilted by a lover, and then committed suicide, might become a ghost and haunt the couple's secret trysting place. Similarly, a man who failed at business might appear each night at his storefront or, perhaps, at that of a former competitor.</p>
					<p>Another common reason for an individual to become a ghost is the denial of a proper burial. A ghost might inhabit the area near its body, waiting for a passerby to promise to bury the remains. The ghost, in its resentment toward all life, becomes an evil creature intent on destruction and suffering.</p>
					<p>In rare circumstances, more than one ghost will haunt the same location. The classic example of this is the haunted ship, a vessel lost at sea, now ethereal and crewed entirely by ghosts. These ships are most often encountered in the presence of St. Elmo's fire, an electrical discharge that causes mysterious lights to appear in the rigging of a ship.</p>
					<p>In many cases, a ghost can be overcome by those who might be no match for it in combat simply by setting right whatever events led to the attainment of the ghost's undead status. For example, a young woman who was betrayed and murdered by someone who pretended to love her might be freed from her curse if the cad were humiliated and ruined. In many cases, however, a ghost's revenge will be far more demanding, often ending in the death of the offender.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>The dreadful fear caused by the ghost, which ages a victim 10 years, is not well understood by the common man, who often ascribes it to the fact that a ghost is 'dead'. If this were the case, then certainly skeletons and zombies would have the same effect, which they do not.</p>
					<p>Common folklore further confuses this fact by relating details of the ghost's physical form: the classic example of which is the headless horseman, thought by many to be particularly frightening simply because he had no head. Under this belief, one could face a ghost if only one had the courage to stand up to him. Such a mistaken impression has cost many lives over the years. Actually, the fear is caused by the supernatural power of the ghost, and has nothing whatsoever to do with courage.</p>

					<p>Ghouls are undead creatures, once human, who now feed on the flesh of corpses. Although the change from human to ghoul has deranged and destroyed their minds, ghouls have a terrible cunning which enables them to hunt their prey most effectively.</p>
					<p>Ghouls are vaguely recognizable as once having been human, but have become horribly disfigured by their change to ghouls. The tongue becomes long and tough for licking marrow from cracked bones, the teeth become sharp and elongated, and the nails grow strong and sharp like claws.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Ghouls attack by clawing with their filthy nails and biting with their fangs. <b><u>Their touch causes humans (including dwarves, gnomes, half-elves, and halflings, but excluding elves) to become rigid unless a saving throw versus paralyzation is successful </u></b>. This paralysis lasts for 3-8 (2+1d6) rounds or until negated by a priest.</p>
					<p>Any human or demi-human (except elves) killed by a ghoulish attack will become a ghoul unless <i>blessed </i>(or <i>blessed </i>and then <i>resurrected </i>). Obviously, this is also avoided if the victim is devoured by the ghouls. Ghoul packs always attack without fear.</p>
					<p>These creatures are subject to all attack forms except <i>sleep </i>and <i>charm </i>spells. They can be turned by priests of any level. The magic <i>circle of protection from evil </i>actually keeps ghouls completely at bay.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Ghouls and ghasts are most frequently encountered around graveyards, where they can find plenty of corpses on which to feed.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Ghouls (and ghasts, as described later) delight in revolting and loathsome things - from which we draw our adjectives 'ghoulish' and 'ghastly'.</p>
					<p><b>Lacedon</b></p>
					<p>The lacedon is a marine form of the ghoul. Lacedons are sometimes found near marine ghosts, particularly ghost ships. Lacedons are less common than ghouls because of the fewer corpses available for them to feed on, but they can often be found swarming around recent shipwrecks in rivers, lakes, and oceans.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Ghast</b></p>
					<p>These creatures are so like ghouls as to be completely indistinguishable from them, and they are usually found only with a pack of ghouls. <b><u>When a pack of ghouls and ghasts attacks it will quickly become evident that ghasts are present, for they exude a carrion stench in a 10' radius which causes retching and nausea unless a saving throw versus poison is made </u></b>. Those failing to make this save will attack at a penalty of -2.</p>
					<p>Worse, the ghast shares the ghoulish ability to paralyzation, and their attack is so potent that it will even affect elves. Paralysis caused by a ghast lasts for 5-10 (4+1d6) rounds or until negated by a priest's <i>remove paralysis </i>spell.</p>
					<p>Ghasts, like ghouls, are undead class and thus <i>sleep </i>and <i>charm </i>spells do not affect them. Though they can be struck by any sort of weapon, cold iron inflicts double normal damage. Clerics can turn them beginning at 2nd level. The <i>circle of protection from evil </i>does not keep them at bay unless it is used in conjunction with cold iron (such as a circle of powdered iron or an iron ring).</p>

					<p>Ghouls are undead creatures, once human, who now feed on the flesh of corpses. Although the change from human to ghoul has deranged and destroyed their minds, ghouls have a terrible cunning which enables them to hunt their prey most effectively.</p>
					<p>Ghouls are vaguely recognizable as once having been human, but have become horribly disfigured by their change to ghouls. The tongue becomes long and tough for licking marrow from cracked bones, the teeth become sharp and elongated, and the nails grow strong and sharp like claws.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Ghouls attack by clawing with their filthy nails and biting with their fangs. <b><u>Their touch causes humans (including dwarves, gnomes, half-elves, and halflings, but excluding elves) to become rigid unless a saving throw versus paralyzation is successful </u></b>. This paralysis lasts for 3-8 (2+1d6) rounds or until negated by a priest.</p>
					<p>Any human or demi-human (except elves) killed by a ghoulish attack will become a ghoul unless <i>blessed </i>(or <i>blessed </i>and then <i>resurrected </i>). Obviously, this is also avoided if the victim is devoured by the ghouls. Ghoul packs always attack without fear.</p>
					<p>These creatures are subject to all attack forms except <i>sleep </i>and <i>charm </i>spells. They can be turned by priests of any level. The magic <i>circle of protection from evil </i>actually keeps ghouls completely at bay.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Ghouls and ghasts are most frequently encountered around graveyards, where they can find plenty of corpses on which to feed.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Ghouls (and ghasts, as described later) delight in revolting and loathsome things - from which we draw our adjectives 'ghoulish' and 'ghastly'.</p>
					<p><b>Lacedon</b></p>
					<p>The lacedon is a marine form of the ghoul. Lacedons are sometimes found near marine ghosts, particularly ghost ships. Lacedons are less common than ghouls because of the fewer corpses available for them to feed on, but they can often be found swarming around recent shipwrecks in rivers, lakes, and oceans.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Ghast</b></p>
					<p>These creatures are so like ghouls as to be completely indistinguishable from them, and they are usually found only with a pack of ghouls. <b><u>When a pack of ghouls and ghasts attacks it will quickly become evident that ghasts are present, for they exude a carrion stench in a 10' radius which causes retching and nausea unless a saving throw versus poison is made </u></b>. Those failing to make this save will attack at a penalty of -2.</p>
					<p>Worse, the ghast shares the ghoulish ability to paralyzation, and their attack is so potent that it will even affect elves. Paralysis caused by a ghast lasts for 5-10 (4+1d6) rounds or until negated by a priest's <i>remove paralysis </i>spell.</p>
					<p>Ghasts, like ghouls, are undead class and thus <i>sleep </i>and <i>charm </i>spells do not affect them. Though they can be struck by any sort of weapon, cold iron inflicts double normal damage. Clerics can turn them beginning at 2nd level. The <i>circle of protection from evil </i>does not keep them at bay unless it is used in conjunction with cold iron (such as a circle of powdered iron or an iron ring).</p>

					<p>Cloud giants consider themselves above all other giants, save storm giants, whom they consider equals. They are creative, appreciate fine things, and are master strategists in battle.</p>
					<p>Cloud giants have muscular human builds and handsome, well-defined features. The typical cloud giant is 24 feet tall and weighs 11,500 pounds. Female cloud giants can be 1 to 2 feet shorter and 1,000 to 2,000 pounds lighter. Cloud giants' skin ranges in color from a milky-white tinged with blue to a light sky blue. Their hair is silvery white or brass and their eyes are an iridescent blue. Cloud giants can live to be 400 years old.</p>
					<p>A cloud giant's natural Armor Class is 0. Although they will wear no armor, these giants prize magical protection devices, and one in 20 will have such a device. Cloud giants dress in clothing made of the finest materials available and wear jewelry. Many of the giants consider their appearance an indication of their station; the more jewelry and the better the clothes, the more important the giant. Cloud giants also appreciate music, and the majority of giants are able to play one or more instruments (their favorite is the harp). Unlike most other giant races, cloud giants leave their treasure in their lairs, carrying with them only food, throwing rocks, 10-100 (10d10) coins, and a musical instrument.</p>
					<p>Cloud giants speak their own tongue and the language of all other giants. In addition, 60% of all cloud giants speak common.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Cloud giants fight in well-organized units, using carefully developed battle plans. They prefer to fight from a position above their opponents. A favorite tactic is to circle the enemy, barraging them with rocks while the giants with magical abilities assault them with spells. Cloud giants can hurl rocks to a maximum of 240 yards, causing 2-24 (2d12) points of damage. Their huge morningstars do 6-24 (6d4) +11 points of damage, three times normal (man-sized) damage plus their strength bonus. One in 10 cloud giants will have a magical weapon.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Cloud giants live in small clans of no more than six giants. However, these clans know the location of 1-8 other clans and will band together with some of these clans for celebrations, battles, or to trade. These joined clans will recognize one among them to be their leader - this is usually an older cloud giant who has magical abilities. One in 10 cloud giants will have spells equivalent to a 4th level wizard, and one in 20 cloud giants will be the equivalent of a 4th level priest. A cloud giant cannot have both priest and wizard abilities.</p>
					<p>If encountered in a lair, half will be immature giants. To determine a giant's maturity, roll 1d4. A roll of 4 indicates an infant with no combat ability and hit points of ogre. Rolls of 1-3 indicate older progeny with hit dice, damage, and 'to hit' rolls equal to that of a fire giant.</p>
					<p>The majority of cloud giants live on cloud-covered mountain peaks in temperate and sub-tropical areas. These giants make their lairs in crude castles. Only 10% of good cloud giants live in castles on enchanted clouds. All giants dwelling there are able to <i>levitate </i>their own weight plus 2,000 pounds three times a day, create a <i>fog cloud </i>three times a day, and create a <i>wall of fog </i>once a day. These abilities are performed as a 6th level wizard.</p>
					<p>There is a 60% chance a cloud giant mountain lair will be guarded by 1-4 spotted lions, 2-5 (1d4+1) owlbears, or 2-5 (1d4+1) griffons (1-2 wyverns for evil cloud giants). In addition, there is a 50% chance the lairs of evil cloud giants will contain 1-20 human and demi-human slaves. There is an 80% chance that a cloud island lair will be guarded by 2-5 (1d4+1) griffons, 2-8 (2d4) hippogriffs, or 2-5 (1d4+1) giant eagles.</p>
					<p>Cloud lairs are fantastic places with giant-sized gardens of fruit trees. According to legend, some giants mine their cloud islands for small chunks of the purest silver.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Cloud giants prefer food that is carefully prepared with spices and sauces, and they relish fine, aged wines.</p>
					<p>Good cloud giants trade with human and demi-human communities for food, wine, jewelry, and cloth. Some cloud giant clans will establish good relations with such communities, and will come to the communities' aid if they are endangered. Evil cloud giants raid human and demi-human communities to get what they want.</p>

					<p>Ettins, or two-headed giants, as they are often called, are vicious and unpredictable hunters that stalk by night and eat any meat they can catch.</p>
					<p>An ettin at first appears to be a stone or hill giant with two heads. On closer inspection, however, the creature's vast differences from the relatively civilized giant races become readily apparent. An ettin has pink to brownish skin, though it appears to be covered in a dark brown hide. This is because an ettin never bathes if it can help it, and is therefore usually encrusted with a thick layer of dirt and grime. Its skin is thick, giving the ettin its low Armor Class. An ettin's hair is long, stringy, and unkempt; its teeth are large, yellowing, and often rotten. The ettin's facial features strongly resemble those of an orc - large watery eyes, turned-up piggish snout, and large mouth.</p>
					<p>An ettin's right head is always the dominant one, and the right arm and leg will likely appear slightly more muscular and well-developed than the left. An ettin wears only rough, untreated skins, which are dirty and unwashed. Obviously, ettins smell very bad, due to their complete lack of grooming habits - good or bad.</p>
					<p>Ettins do not have a true language of their own. Instead, they speak a mish-mash of orc, goblin, giant dialects, and the alignment tongue of chaotic evil creatures. Any adventurer who speaks orcish can understand 50% of what an ettin says.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Having two heads is definitely an advantage for the ettins, as one is always alert, watching for danger and potential food. This means that an ettin is surprised only on the roll of a 1 on 1d10. An ettin also has infravision up to 90 feet, which enables it to hunt and fight effectively in the dark. Though ettins have a low intelligence, they are cunning fighters. They prefer to ambush their victims rather than charge into a straight fight, but once the battle has started, ettins usually fight furiously until all enemies are dead, or the battle turns against them. Ettins do not retreat easily, only doing so if victory is impossible.</p>
					<p>In combat, an ettin has two attacks. Because each of its two heads controls an arm, an ettin does not suffer an attack roll penalty for attacking with both arms. An ettin always attacks with two large clubs, often covered with spikes. Using these weapons, the ettin causes <b>2d8 points of damage </b>with its left arm, and <b>3d6 points of damage </b>with its right. If the ettin is disarmed or unable to use a weapon, it attacks empty-handed, inflicting <b>1d10 points of damage </b>with its left fist and 2d6 points with its right.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Ettins like to establish their lairs in remote, rocky areas. They dwell in dark, underground caves that stink of decaying food and offal. Ettins are generally solitary, and mated pairs only stay together for a few months after a young ettin is born to them. Young ettins mature very quickly, and within eight to ten months after they are born, they are self-sufficient enough to go off on their own.</p>
					<p>On rare occasions, however, a particularly strong ettin may gather a small group of 1d4 ettins together. This small band of ettins stays together only as long as the leader remains alive and undefeated in battle. Any major defeat shatters the leader's hold over the band, and they each go their separate ways.</p>
					<p>Ettins collect treasure only because it can buy them the services of goblins or orcs. These creatures sometimes serve ettins by building traps around their lairs, or helping to fight off a powerful opponent. Ettins have also been known to occasionally keep 1-2 cave bears in the area of their lairs.</p>
					<p>The sloppy caves of ettins are a haven for parasites and vermin, and it isn't unusual for the ettins themselves to be infected with various parasitic diseases. Adventurers rummaging through ettin lairs for valuables will find the task disgusting, if not dangerous.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Because ettin society is so primitive, they produce little of any value to civilized creatures. Ettins tolerate the presence of other creatures, like orcs, in the area of their lair if they can be useful in some way. Otherwise, ettins tend to be violently isolationist, crushing trespassers without question.</p>

					<p>Fire giants are brutal, ruthless, and militaristic.</p>
					<p>They are tall, but squat, resembling huge dwarves. An adult male is 18 feet tall, has a 12 foot chest, and weighs about 7,500 pounds. Fire giants have coal black skin, flaming red or bright orange hair, and prognathous jaws that reveal dirty ivory or yellow teeth. They can live to be 350 years old.</p>
					<p>A fire giant's natural Armor Class is 5. Warriors usually wear banded mail and round metal helmets (AC -1). They carry their belongings in huge sacks. A typical fire giant's sack contains 2-5 (1d4+1) throwing rocks, the giant's wealth, a tinderbox, and 3-12 (3d4) common items. Everything they own is battered, filthy, and smelly, making it difficult to identify valuable items.</p>
					<p>All fire giants can speak the language of all giants and their own tongue.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Fire giants are <b><u>immune to nonmagical fire and heat, as well as red dragon breath </u></b>. They are <b><u>resistant to all types of magical fire; such attacks inflict -1 hit point per die of damage </u></b>. Adult fire giants can hurl rocks for 2-20 (2d10) points of damage. Their minimum range is 3 yards while their maximum is 200 yards. They can catch similar large missiles 50% of the time. They usually fight in disciplined groups, throwing rocks until they run out of ammunition or the opponent closes. Fire giants often wait in ambush at lava pools or hot springs, hurling heated rocks at victims for an extra <b>1-6 points of damage </b>.</p>
					<p>Warriors favor huge two-handed swords. A fire giant's oversized weapons do double normal (man-sized) damage to all opponents, plus the giant's strength bonus. Thus, a fire giant two-handed sword does 2-20 (2d10) +10 points of damage.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Fire giants live in well organized military groups, occupying large castles or caverns. When encountered in their lair there will be 13-20 (1d8+12) giants, half of whom will be immature giants. To determine a giant's maturity, roll 1d4. A roll of 4 indicates an infant with no combat ability and the hit points of an ogre while rolls of 1-3 indicate older progeny with Hit Dice, damage, and attack rolls reduced by 1, 2 or 3, respectively.</p>
					<p>Their lairs are always protected by vigilant watchmen, and sometimes by traps. Fire giants favor deadfalls that can crush intruders for 5-30 (5d6) points of damage, and large crossbow devices that fire one, two, or three huge bolts for 2-16 (2d8) points of damage each.</p>
					<p>Particularly intelligent fire giant leaders will command groups three or four times normal size. One who commands 30 or more giants usually will call himself a king. Kings always will have better than normal armor and a magical weapon of +1 to +3.</p>
					<p>There is a 20% chance that any band of fire giants will have a shaman (80%) or witch doctor (20%). If the group is lead by a king, there is an 80% chance of a spell caster. Fire giant shamans are priests of up to 7th level. A shaman can cast normal or reversed spells from the Elemental, Healing, Charm, Protection, Divination, or Combat spheres. Fire giant witch doctors are priest/wizards of up to 7th/3rd level; they prefer spells that can detect or thwart intruders.</p>
					<p>Fire giants often capture and tame other creatures as guards. There is a 50% chance that a fire giant lair will contain 1-4 hell hounds. Larger than normal groups check once for every 10 giants. Bands with 30 or more giants have a additional 30% chance to have 2-5 (1d4+1) trolls, larger groups check once for every 20 giants. A king's group has a 20% chance to have 1-2 red dragons of age category 2-5 (1d4+1) in addition to other guards. Fire giants frequently take captives to hold for ransom or use as slaves. There is a 25% chance that a lair will contain 1-2 captives, larger bands check once per 10 giants.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Fire giants live wherever there is a lot of heat. They prefer volcanic regions or areas with hot springs. Frequently they share their lairs with other fire-dwelling creatures such as salamanders or fire elementals.</p>
					<p>Fire giants prefer to eat meat and bread, they can hunt and kill their own meat, but raid human and demi-human settlements for grain, captives, and treasure.</p>

					<p>Like all evil giants, frost giants have a reputation for crudeness and stupidity. This reputation is deserved, but frost giants are crafty fighters.</p>
					<p>Frost giants have muscular, roughly human builds. The typical adult male is 21' tall and weighs about 8,000 pounds. Females are slightly shorter and lighter, but otherwise identical to males. Frost giants have snow-white or ivory skin. Their hair is light blue or dirty yellow, with matching eyes. They can live to be 250 years old.</p>
					<p>A frost giant's natural Armor Class is 5. Warriors usually wear chain mail and metal helmets decorated with horns or feathers (AC 0). They also wear skins and pelts, along with any jewelry they own.</p>
					<p>Frost giants carry their belongings in huge sacks. A typical frost giant's sack contains 2-5 (1d4+1) throwing rocks, the giant's wealth, and 3-12 (3d4) mundane items. Everything in a giant's bag is old, worn, dirty, and smelly, making the identification of any valuable items difficult.</p>
					<p>Frost giants speak their own language and the language common to all giants.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Frost giants are <b><u>immune to cold </u></b>. Adult frost giants can hurl rocks for 2-20 (2d10) points of damage. Their minimum range is 3 yards while their maximum is 200 yards. They can catch similar large missiles 40% of the time. They usually will start combat at a distance, throwing rocks until they run out of ammunition, or the opponent closes. One of their favorite strategies is to ambush victims by hiding buried in the snow at the top of an icy or snowy slope where opponents will have difficulty reaching them.</p>
					<p>Warriors favor huge battle axes. A frost giant's oversized weapons do double normal (man-sized) damage to all opponents, plus the giant's strength bonus. Thus, a frost giant battle axe does 2-16 (2d8) +9 points of damage.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Frost giants live in small bands consisting of a chief, his henchmen, and their camp followers. A band usually will occupy a crude castle or frigid cavern. When encountered in their lair there will be 9-16 1d8+8) giants; half of whom will be immature. To determine a giant's maturity, roll 1d4. A roll of 4 indicates an infant with no combat ability and hit points of ogre; rolls of 1-3 indicate older progeny with hit dice, damage, and attack rolls equal to that of a stone giant.</p>
					<p>Particularly strong or intelligent frost giant chieftains will command bands three or four times normal size. A chieftain who commands 20 or more giants is called a jarl. Jarls always will have better than normal armor and a weapon of +1 to +3 enchantment.</p>
					<p>There is a 20% chance that any band of frost giants will have a shaman (80%) or witch doctor (20%). If the group is led by a jarl, there is an 80% chance for a spell caster. Frost giant shamans are priests of up to 7th level. A shaman can cast normal or reversed spells from the healing, charm, protection, divination, or weather spheres. Frost giant witch doctors are priest/wizards of up to 7th/3rd level; they prefer spells that can bewilder and confound other giants. Favorite spells include: <i>unseen servant </i>, <i>shocking grasp </i>, <i>detect magic </i>, <i>ventriloquism </i>, <i>deeppockets </i>, <i>ESP </i>, <i>mirror image </i>, and <i>invisibility </i>.</p>
					<p>Frost giants often capture and tame other creatures as guards. There is a 50% chance that a frost giant lair will contain 1-6 winter wolves. Larger than normal groups check once for every eight giants. Bands with 20 or more giants have a additional 30% chance to have 1-4 yeti, larger groups check once for every 16 giants. A jarl's band has a 20% chance to have 1-2 subdued white dragons in addition to other guards. The dragons will be age category 2-5 (1d4+1). Frost giants also take captives to hold for ransom or use as slaves. There is a 15% chance that a lair will contain 1-2 captives, larger bands check once per eight giants. Captives can be of any race.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Frost giants live in frigid, arctic lands with glaciers and heavy snowfall. Frost giants eat mostly meat, which they can hunt and kill themselves. They raid human and demi-human settlements for foodstuffs and other booty.</p>

					<p>Hill giants are selfish, cunning brutes who survive through hunting and by terrorizing and raiding nearby communities. Despite their low intelligence, they are capable fighters.</p>
					<p>Hill giants are oddly simian and barbaric in appearance, with overly long arms, stooped shoulders, and low foreheads. Even though they are the smallest of the giants, their limbs are more muscular and massive than those of the other giant races. The average hill giant is 16 feet tall and weighs about 4,500 pounds. Females have the same builds as males. Their skin color ranges from a light tan to a deep ruddy brown. Their hair is brown or black, and their eyes are black. Hill giants can live to be 200 years old.</p>
					<p>Hill giants' natural Armor Class is 5. This is reduced to an Armor Class of 3 when they wear crudely-sewn animal hides, which are the equivalent of leather armor. Nearly all hill giants wear these hides, which are a symbol of esteem in some hill giant communities -- the more hides a giant has, the more large kills to his credit. Only a few (5%) of the giants fashion metal armor from the armor of men they have defeated. These giants have an Armor Class of 0. Like other races of giants, hill giants carry their belongings with them in huge hide sacks. A typical hill giant's bag will contain 2-8 (2d4) throwing rocks, the giant's wealth, and 1-8 additional common items.</p>
					<p>Hill giants speak their own language and a tongue common to all giants. In addition, 50% also speak ogre.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Hill giants prefer to fight their opponents from high rocky outcroppings where they can pelt their targets with rocks and boulders while limiting the risks posed to themselves.</p>
					<p>Hill giants' favorite weapons are oversized clubs which do 2-12 +7 points of damage (double the damage of a man-sized club plus their strength bonus). They hurl rocks for 2-16 (2d8) points of damage. Their targets for such attacks must be between 3 and 200 yards away from the giant. They can catch rocks or other similar missiles 30% of the time.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>A hill giant lair will have 9-16 (1d8+8) giants; usually an extended family. Sometimes these families will accept lone hill giants into their folds. If six or more giants are encountered in a lair, half of them will be male, one quarter will be female, and the remainder will be immature giants. To determine a giant's maturity, roll 1d4. A roll of 4 indicates an infant with no combat ability and hit points of gnoll; rolls of 1-3 indicate older progeny with hit dice, damage, and attack rolls equal to that of an ogre.</p>
					<p>Occasionally a hill giant with an average intelligence can be found. Such a giant is capable of rallying bands of his peers so 2, 3, or 4 times the number of giants usually appearing can be encountered. These 'giant kings', as they call themselves, stage raids on human towns or against other races of giants.</p>
					<p>Although hill giants prefer temperate areas, they can be found in practically any climate where there is an abundance of hills and mountains. They lair in caves, excavated dens, or crude huts. Those who live in colder climates have developed more skills with preparing and using skins to keep themselves warm and to keep the harsh winds out of their lairs.</p>
					<p>There is a 50% chance a band of hill giants will have guards in their lairs, and the guarding creatures will be 2-8 (2d4) dire wolves (50%), 1-3 giant lizards (30%), or a group of 2-8 (2d4) ogres (20%).</p>
					<p>The majority of hill giants are suspicious of magic and will seek to destroy magic items they acquire as treasure. They ceremonially kill mages.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Hill giants' main diet consists of meat, which they obtain by hunting. The flesh of young green dragons is considered a delicacy, and frequently giants who live on hills and mountains covered with forests will organize hunting parties in search of green dragon lairs. In turn, green dragons have been known to hunt hill giants.</p>
					<p>Sometimes bands of hill giants will trade with each other or with bands of ogres to get foodstuffs and trinkets.</p>

					<p>Stone giants are lean, but muscular. Their hard, hairless flesh is smooth and gray, making it easy for them to blend in with their mountainous surroundings. Their gaunt facial features and deep, sunken black eyes make them seem perpetually grim.</p>
					<p>The typical stone giant is 18' tall and weighs 9,000 pounds because of its dense flesh. Females are a little shorter and lighter. The giants' natural Armor Class is 0. They do not wear armor to augment that, preferring to wear stone-colored garments. Stone giants can live to be 800 years old.</p>
					<p>Stone giants, like several other giant races, carry some of their belongings with them. They leave their more valuable items in their lairs, however. A typical stone giant's bag will contain 2-24 (2d12) throwing rocks, a portion of the giant's wealth, and 1-8 additional common items.</p>
					<p>Stone giants speak their own language, as well as those of hill giants, cloud giants, and storm giants. In addition, 50% of the giants also speak the common language of man.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>When possible, stone giants fight from a distance. They are able to hurl rocks a minimum distance of 3 yards to a maximum distance of 300 yards, doing 3-30 (3d10) points of damage with each rock. These giants are able to catch stones and similar missiles 90% of the time. A favorite tactic of stone giants is to stand nearly motionless against rocks, blending in with the background, then moving forward to throw rocks, surprising their foes. Many giants set up piles of rocks near their lair which can be triggered like an avalanche when intruders get too close.</p>
					<p>When stone giants are forced into melee combat, they use large clubs chiseled out of stone which do 2-12 (2d6) +8 points of damage; double normal (man-sized) club damage plus the giant's strength bonus.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Stone giants prefer to dwell in deep caves high on rocky, storm-swept mountains. They normally live in the company of their relatives, though such a clans usually include no more than 10 giants. Clans of giants do locate their lairs near each other, however, for a sense of community and protection. A mountain range commonly has 2-8 clans lairing there.</p>
					<p>Stone giants are crude artists, painting scenes of their lives on the walls of their lairs and on tanned hide scrolls. Some giants are fond of music and play stone flutes and drums. Others make simple jewelry, fashioning painted stone beads into necklaces.</p>
					<p>If eight or more giants are encountered in a clan's lair, one quarter will be female, one quarter male, and the remainder offspring. To determine a giant's maturity, roll 1d4. A roll of 4 indicates an infant with no combat ability and hit points of an ogre; rolls of 1-3 indicate older progeny with hit dice, damage, and attack rolls equal to those of a hill giant.</p>
					<p>One in 20 stone giants develop special abilities related to their environment. These giant elders are able to <i>stone shape </i>, <i>stone tell </i>, and <i>transmute rock to mud </i>(or <i>mud to rock </i>) once per day as if they were 5th level mages. One in 10 of these exceptional giants can also cast spells as if he were a 3rd level wizard. Their spells can be determined randomly or chosen to fit a specific encounter as desired. Frequently these giants are able to rise to positions of power and are considered the leaders of several clans.</p>
					<p>Stone giants are usually found in mountain ranges in temperate and sub-tropical areas. Stone giants are fond of cave bears and 75% of their lairs will have 1-8 of them as guards. The few stone giants living in cold areas use polar bears as guards.</p>
					<p>Stone giants are playful, especially at night. They are fond of rock throwing contests and other games that test their might. Tribes of giants will often gather to toss rocks at each other, the losing side being the giants who are hit more often.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Stone giants are omnivorous, but they will eat only fresh food. They cook and eat their meat quickly after it has been killed. They use the skins of the animals for blankets and trade what they do not need with nearby human communities in exchange for bolts of cloth or herd animals which they use for food. Many stone giant bands keep giant goats in and near their lairs so they will have a continuous supply of milk, cheese, and butter.</p>

					<p>Storm giants are gentle and reclusive. They are usually tolerant of others, but can be very dangerous when angry.</p>
					<p>Storm giants resemble well-formed humans of gargantuan proportions. Adult males and females are about 26' tall and weigh about 15,000 pounds. Storm giants have pale, light green or (rarely) violet skin. Green-skinned storm giants have dark green hair and glittering emerald eyes. Violet-skinned storm giants have deep violet or blue-black hair with silvery gray or purple eyes. Storm giants can live to be 600 years old.</p>
					<p>A storm giant's garb usually is a short, loose tunic belted at the waist, sandals or bare feet, and a headband. They wear a few pieces of simple, but finely crafted jewelry: anklets (favored by bare-footed giants), rings, or circlets being most common.</p>
					<p>Storm giants usually carry pouches attached to their belts. These hold only a few tools, necessities, and a simple musical instrument - usually a panpipe or harp. Other than the jewelry they wear, they prefer to leave their wealth in their lairs.</p>
					<p>They speak their own language as well as cloud giant, the tongue common to all giants, and the common tongue of humankind.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>All storm giants are <b><u>immune to electricity and lightning </u></b>. They use weapons and special abilities instead of hurling rocks, but can catch large missiles 65% of the time.</p>
					<p>Storm giants are born with <i>water breathing </i>ability, and can move, attack, and use magic under water as if they were on land. Juvenile and adult storm giants can cast <i>control weather </i>and <i>levitate </i>spells lifting their own weight and as much as 4,000 additional pounds twice a day. Adult storm giants also can <i>call lightning </i>(3 bolts of 15 8-sided dice each), <i>lightning bolt </i>(1 bolt of 15 6-sided dice), <i>control winds </i>, and use <i>weather summoning </i>once a day. A storm giant uses its magical abilities at 15th level. An angry storm giant usually will <i>summon </i>a storm and <i>call lightning </i>.</p>
					<p>They employ gigantic two-handed swords in battle. A storm giant's oversized weapons do triple normal (man-sized) damage to all opponents, plus the giant's strength bonus. Thus, a storm giant's two-handed sword does 3-30 (3d10) +12 points of damage. They also use massive composite bows which have a 300 yard range and do 3-18 (3d6) points of damage. There is a 10% chance that any storm giant will have enchanted weapons.</p>
					<p>A storm giant's natural Armor Class is 0. In battle, storm giants usually wear elaborate bronze plate mail (AC -6).</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Storm giants are retiring and solitary, but not shy. They live in castles built on cloud islands (60%), mountain peaks (20%), or underwater (10%). They live quiet, reflective lives and spend their time musing about the world, composing and playing music, and tilling their land or gathering food. Land-and air-dwelling storm giants usually are on good terms with neighboring silver dragons and good cloud giants, and cooperate with them for mutual defense. Aquatic storm giants have similar relationships with mermen and bronze dragons.</p>
					<p>When two or more storm giants are encountered in lair they will be a mated couple and their children. To determine each young giant's maturity, roll 1d4. A roll of 4 indicates an infant with no combat ability and hit points of ogre; rolls of 1-3 indicate older progeny with hit dice, damage, and attack rolls equal to that of a cloud giant.</p>
					<p>There is a 20% chance that an adult storm giant is also a priest (70%) or priest/wizard (30%). Storm giants can attain 9th level as priests and 7th level as wizards. Storm giant priests can cast regular spells from the Animal, Charm, Combat, Creation, Guardian, Healing, Plant, Weather, and Sun spheres. Storm giant wizards are generalists, and typically know spells from the Alteration, Invocation/Evocation, Conjuration/Summoning, and Abjuration schools.</p>
					<p>Storm giant lairs are always protected by guards. Land or aerial lairs have 1-2 rocs (70%), which also serve a mounts, or 1-4 griffons (30%). Underwater lairs have 2-8 (2d4) sea lions.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Storm giants live off the land in the immediate vicinity of their lairs. If the natural harvest is not enough to sustain them, they create and carefully till large areas of gardens, fields, and vineyards. They do not keep animals for food, preferring to hunt.</p>

					<p>The gibbering mouther is an amoeboid form of life composed entirely of mouth and eyes. With its eyes and mouths closed, it appears to be a lump of earthly material, surprising creatures that stumble across it. Its only motive is to eat whatever is edible and within reach, be it animal, vegetable, or mineral.</p>
					<p>Gibbering mouthers move by oozing forward, fastening several mouths to the ground and pulling themselves along. A mouther may move faster over fluid and viscous terrain, such as mud and quicksand, by swimming.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>The brain of a mouther is located in its midportion, and its gelatinous body makes it difficult to strike this spot, hence its relatively low Armor class.</p>
					<p>The mouther attacks in three ways: <i>gibbering </i>, spitting and biting. <b><u>When any edible object is sighted by a mouther, it begins gibbering incoherently, causing confusion among all within a 60-foot radius who fails a saving throw vs. spell </u></b>. Each character who fails must immediately roll 1d8 to determine which of the following effects occurs. On a roll of 1, the victim wanders aimlessly for one round; on a roll of 2-5, the victim stands motionless, stunned for one round; on a roll of 6-7, the victim attacks the nearest living creature for one round; and on a roll of 8, the victim runs in fear for two rounds.</p>
					<p>The spittle of a gibbering mouther bursts into a bright flare if it strikes any hard surface. <b><u>The resulting flash blinds characters looking at it if they fail to save vs. petrification - the blindness lasts 1d3 rounds </u></b>. The mouther may then attempt to bite blinded opponents with a +2 bonus to its attack rolls. Blinded victims attack with a -4 penalty.</p>
					<p>A mouther attacks by biting with six mouths per round. Each attack roll exceeding the number required to hit by 2 or more indicates that the mouth attaches to the victim and drains an additional point per round. When three or more mouths are attached to a single victim, that character must make a successful Dexterity check each round thereafter or slip and fall. The mouther will then flow over the victim and bite with 12 mouths, gaining a +4 bonus to strike its prone opponent. Once it pulls down one victim, a mouther tries to trap another.</p>
					<p>If a victim reaches 0 hit points, he is absorbed into the mouther, giving it another mouth and pair of eyes, as well as 1 hit point permanently, up to the maximum for its Hit Dice. Only living flesh can be absorbed like this.</p>
					<p>A mouther liquefies the ground and stone within a 5-foot radius and controls the consistency of the material, changing it to doughy quicksand. It requires 30 seconds to alter earth to quicksand, and a full round to mutate stone to earth.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Like other amoeboid life forms, gibbering mouthers reproduce by asexual fission. When a mouther has absorbed enough victims to gain maximum hit points, it splits in two. Each mouther has 4+3 Hit Dice (one has 17 hit points, the other has 18). The mouther retreats to some small, dark den before the four-hour process begins. When the two new mouthers recover from the dividing process (which takes 7+3d12 turns), each seeks its own new territory.</p>
					<p>Gibbering mouthers avoid each other's territories and even physical contact with one another. It's believed that bringing two mouthers in physical contact forces them to merge, creating a larger creature with twice the size, HD, and number of attacks, but half the already-slow movement of the parent monsters. These great beasts strip the land so thoroughly that they generally die of starvation as soon as prey becomes scarce.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Gibbering mouthers are unnatural creatures, usually created by foul sorcery and kept as guards by mages or obscene cults. Although they can survive in the wild, they are more scavenger than hunters, and they rarely establish reproducing populations in any but the most lush swamps.</p>

					<p>Gnolls are large, evil, hyena-like humanoids that roam about in loosely organized bands.</p>
					<p>While the body of a gnoll is shaped like that of a large human, the details are those of a hyena. They stand erect on two legs and have hands that can manipulate as well as those of any human. They have greenish gray skin, darker near the muzzle, with a short reddish gray to dull yellow mane.</p>
					<p>Gnolls have their own language and many also speak the tongues of flinds, trolls, orcs, or hobgoblins.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Gnolls seek to overwhelm their opponents by sheer numbers, using horde tactics. When under the direction of flinds or a strong leader, they can be made to hold rank and fight as a unit. While they do not often lay traps, they will ambush or attempt to attack from a flank or rear position. Gnolls favor swords (15%), pole arms (35%) and battle axes (20%) in combat, but also use bows (15%), morningstars (15%).</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Gnolls are most often encountered underground or inside abandoned ruins. When above ground they operate primarily at night. Gnoll society is ruled by the strongest, using fear and intimidation. When found underground, they will have (30% chance) 1-3 trolls as guards and servants. Above ground they keep pets (65% of the time) such as 4-16 hyenas (80%) or 2-12 hyaenodons (20%) which can act as guards.</p>
					<p>A gnoll lair will contain between 20 and 200 adult males. For every 20 gnolls, there will be a 3 Hit Die leader. If 100 or more are encountered there will also be a chieftain who has 4 Hit Dice, an Armor Class of 3, and who receives a +3 on his damage rolls due to his great strength. Further, each chieftain will be protected by 2-12 (2d6) elite warrior guards of 3 Hit Dice (AC 4, +2 damage).</p>
					<p>In a lair, there will be females equal to half the number of males. Females are equal to males in combat, though not usually as well armed or armored. There will also be twice as many young as there are adults in the lair, but they do not fight. Gnolls always have at least 1 slave for every 10 adults in the lair, and may have many more.</p>
					<p>Gnolls will work together with orcs, hobgoblins, bugbears, ogres, and trolls. If encountered as a group, there must be a relative equality of strength. Otherwise the gnolls will kill and eat their partners (hunger comes before friendship or fear) or be killed and eaten by them. They dislike goblins, kobolds, giants, humans, demi-humans and any type of manual labor.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Gnolls eat anything warm blooded, favoring intelligent creatures over animals because they scream better. They will completely hunt out an area before moving on. It may take several years for the game to return. When allowed to die of old age, the typical gnoll lives to be about 35 years old.</p>
					<p><b>Flind</b></p>
					<p>The flind is similar to a gnoll in body style, though it is a little shorter, and broader. They are more muscular than their cousins. Short, dirty, brown and red fur covers their body. Their foreheads do not slope back as far, and their ears are rounded, but still animal like.</p>
					<p>Flinds use clubs (75%) which inflict <b>1-6 points of damage </b>and flindbars (25%) which do <b>1-4 points of damage </b>. A flindbar is a pair of chain-linked iron bars which are spun at great speed. A flind with a flindbar can strike twice per round. <b><u>Each successful hit requires the victim to save vs. wands or have his weapon entangled in the chain and torn from his grasp by the flindbar </u></b>. Due to their great strength, flinds get a +1 on their attack rolls.</p>
					<p>Flinds are regarded with reverence and awe by gnolls. Flind leaders are 3+3 Hit Dice, at least 13 intelligence and 18 charisma to gnolls (15 to flinds), and always use flindbars.</p>

					<p>Small cousins of the dwarves, gnomes are friendly but reticent, quick to help their friends but rarely seen by other races unless they want to be. They tend to dwell underground in hilly, wooded regions where they can pursue their interests in peace. Gnomes can be fighters or priests, but most prefer to become thieves or illusionists instead. Multi-class characters are more common among the gnomes than any other demihuman race.</p>
					<p>Gnomes strongly resemble small, thin, nimble dwarves, with the exception of two notable facial features: gnomes prefer to keep their beards short and stylishly-trimmed, and they take pride in their enormous noses (often fully twice the size of any dwarf or human's). Skin, hair, and eye color vary somewhat by subrace: the most common type of gnome, the Rock Gnome, has skin ranging from a dark tan to a woody brown (sometimes with a hint of gray), pale hair, and eyes any shade of blue. Gnomish clothing tends toward leather and earth tones, brightened by a bit of intricately wrought jewelry or stitching. Rock gnomes have an average life span of around 450 years, although some live to be 600 years or more.</p>
					<p>Gnomes speak their own language, and each subrace has its own distinctive dialect. Many gnomes learn the tongues of humans, kobolds, goblins, halflings, and dwarves in order to communicate with their neighbors, and some Rock Gnomes are able to communicate with burrowing mammals via a basic language of grunts, snorts, and signs.</p>
					<p>Gnomes posses infravision to 60 feet, and the ability to detect sloping passages (1-5 on 1d6), unsafe stonework (1-7 on 1d10), and approximate depth (1-4 on 1d6) and direction (1-3 on 1d6) underground. They are highly <b><u>resistant to magic, gaining a +1 bonus to their saving throws for each 3 </u></b>.5 points of Constitution (a typical gnome will have a bonus of +3 to +4). Unfortunately, this also means that there is a 20% chance that any magical item a gnome attempts to use will malfunction (armor, weapons, and illusionary items exempted).</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Gnomes prefer the use of strategy over brute force in combat and will often use illusions in imaginative ways to 'even the odds\xA8. Their great hatred of kobolds and goblins, their traditional enemies, gives them a+1 on their attack rolls when fighting these beings. They are adept at dodging the attacks of large opponents, forcing all giant class creatures (gnolls, bugbears, ogres, trolls, giants, etc.) to subtract 4 from their attack rolls when fighting gnomes.</p>
					<p>Gnomes can use any weapon that matches their size and often carry a second (or even a third) weapon as a back-up. Short swords, hammers, and spears are favorite melee weapons, with short bows, crossbows, slings, and darts coming into play when distance weapons are called for; virtually every gnome will also carry a sharp knife somewhere on his or her person as a final line of defense.</p>
					<p>A typical rock gnome will wear studded leather armor and use a small shield (AC 6). Their leaders will have chain mail (AC 4), and any gnome above 5th level has plate mail (AC 2). There is a 10% chance for each level above 5th that the gnome's armor and/or weapon is magical (roll separately for each). Spell casters have a 10% chance per level of having 1-3 magical items usable by their character class.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Gnomes live in underground burrows in remote hilly, wooded regions. They are clannish, with friendly rivalries occurring between neighboring clans. They spend their lives mining, crafting fine jewelry, and enjoying the fruits of their labors. Gnomes work hard, and they play hard. They observe many festivals and holidays, which usually involve games, nose measuring contests, and swapping of grand tales. Their society is well organized, with many levels of responsibility, culminating in a single chief who is advised by clerics in matters directly relating to their calling.</p>
					<p>A gnomish lair is home to some 40-400 (4d10&#62;010) gnomes, one-quarter of them children. For every 40 adults there is a fighter of 2nd to 4th level. If 160 or more are encountered there is also a 5th-level chief and a 3rd-level lieutenant. If 200 or more are met, there is a cleric or illusionist of 4th to 6th level. If 320 or more are present, add a 6th-level fighter, two 5th-level fighters, a 7th-level cleric, four 3rd-level clerics, a 5th-level illusionist, and two 2nd-level illusionists.</p>
					<p>Gnomes often befriend burrowing mammals, so 5d6 badgers (70%), 3d4 giant badgers (20%), or 2d4 wolverines (10%) will be present as well. These animals are neither pets nor servants, but allies who will help guard the clan.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Gnomes are very much a magical part of nature, existing in harmony with the land they inhabit. They choose to live underground but remain near the surface in order to enjoy its beauty.</p>
					<p><b>Svirfneblin (Deep Gnome)</b></p>
					<p>Far beneath the surface of the earth dwell the Svirfneblin, or Deep Gnomes. Small parties of these demihumans roam the Underdark's mazes of small passageways searching for gemstones. They are said to dwell in great cities consisting of a closely connected series of tunnels, buildings, and caverns in which up to a thousand of these diminutive creatures live. They keep the location of these hidden cities secret in order to protect them from their deadly foes, the kuo-toa, Drow, and mind flayers.</p>
					<p>Svirfneblin are slightly smaller than rock gnomes, but their thin, wiry, gnarled frames are just as strong. Their skin is rock-colored, usually medium brown to brownish gray, and their eyes are gray. Male svirfneblin are completely bald; female deep gnomes have stringy gray hair. The average svirfneblin life span is 250 years.</p>
					<p>Svirfneblin mining teams and patrols work together so smoothly that to outside observers they appear to communicate with each other by some form of racial empathy. They speak their own dialect of gnomish that other gnomish subraces are 60% likely to understand. Most deep gnomes are also able to converse in Underworld Common and speak and understand a fair amount of kuo-toan and drow. These small folk can also converse with any creature from the elemental plane of Earth via a curious 'language' consisting solely of vibrations (each pitch conveys a different message), although only on a very basic level.</p>
					<p>All svirfneblin have the innate ability to cast blindness, blur, and change self once per day. Deep gnomes also radiate non-detection identical to the spell of the same name. Deep gnomes have 120-foot infravision, as well as all the detection abilities of rock gnomes. (See also Wizard Spells, Player's Handbook)</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Despite their metal armor and arms, these quick, small folk are able to move very quietly. Deep gnomes are able to 'freeze' in place for long periods without any hint of movement, making them 60% unlikely to be seen by any observer, even those with infravision. They are surprised only on a roll of 1 on 1d10 due to their keen hearing and smelling abilities and surprise opponents 90% of the time.</p>
					<p>The deep gnomes wear leather jacks sewn with rings or scales of mithral steel alloy over fine chainmail shirts, giving a typical svirfneblin warrior an Armor Class of 2. They do not usually carry shields, since these would hinder movement through the narrow corridors they favor. For every level above 3rd, a Deep Gnome's Armor Class improves by one point - a 4th-level deep gnome has AC 1, a 5th-level deep gnome, AC 0; to a maximum of AC 6.</p>
					<p>All deep gnomes are 20% magic resistant, gaining an extra +5% magic resistance for each level they attain above 3rd. They are <b><u>immune to illusions, phantasms, and hallucinations </u></b>. Because of their high wisdom, speed, and agility, they make all saving throws at +3, except against poison, when their bonus is +2.</p>
					<p>Deep Gnomes are typically armed with a pick and a dagger which, while nonmagical, gain a +1 bonus to attacks and damage due to their finely-honed edges. Svirfneblin also carry 1d4+6 special stun darts, throwing them to a range of 40 feet, with a +2 bonus to hit. <b><u>Each dart releases a small puff of gas when it strikes; any creature inhaling the gas must save vs. poison or be stunned for 1 round and slowed for the next four rounds </u></b>. Elite warriors (3rd level and above) often carry hollow darts with acid inside (+2d4 to damage) and crystal caltrops which, when stepped on, release a powerful sleep gas.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Svirfneblin society is strictly divided between the sexes: females are in charge of food production and running the city, while males patrol its borders and mine for precious stones. A svirfneblin city will have both a king and a queen, each of whom is independent and has his or her own sphere of responsibility. Since only males ever leave the city, the vast majority of encounters will be with deep gnome mining parties seeking for new lodes. For every four svirfneblin encountered, there will be an overseer with 4+7 Hit Dice. Groups of more than 20 will be led by a burrow warden (6+9 Hit Dice) with two 5th-level assistants (5+8 Hit Dice).</p>
					<p>It is 25% probable that a 6th-level deep gnome will have illusionist abilities of 5th, 6th, or 7th level. Deep Gnomes who are not illusionists gain the ability at 6th level to summon an earth elemental (50% chance of success) once per day.</p>
					<p>Deep gnome clerics have no ability to turn undead.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Stealth, cleverness, and tenacity enable the svirfneblin to survive in the extremely hostile environment of the Underdark. They love gems, especially rubies, and will take great risks in order to gain them. Their affinity for stone is such that creatures from the elemental plane of Earth are 90% unlikely to harm a deep gnome, though they might demand a hefty tithe in gems or precious metals for allowing the gnome to escape.</p>
					<p><b>Tinker Gnome (Minoi)</b></p>
					<p>Cheerful, industrious, and inept, tinker gnomes originated on Krynn, but they have spread to many other worlds via spelljamming ships. Physically similar to rock gnomes, even to the extent of sharing the same infravision range, magic resistance, combat bonuses, and detection abilities, their history and culture are so radically different as to qualify them for consideration as a separate subrace.</p>
					<p>Graceful and quick in their movements, tinker gnomes' hands are deft and sure. Tinkers have rich brown skin, white hair, and china-blue or violet eyes. Males favor oddly-styled beards and moustaches, and both sexes have rounded ears and typically large gnomish noses. Tinkers who avoid getting blown up in an experiment live for 250-300 years.</p>
					<p>Tinker gnomes speak very rapidly, running their words together in sentences that never seem to end. They are capable of talking and listening at the same time: when two tinkers meet, they babble away, answering questions asked by the other as part of the same continuous sentence.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Tinker gnomes rarely carry weapons, although some of their ever present tools can be pressed into service at need. However, they delight in invention and are always devising strange weapons of dubious utility, from the three barrel water blaster to the multiple spear flinger. Tinkers can wear any type of armor but typically outfit themselves in a variety of mismatched pieces for an effective AC of 5.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Tinker gnomes establish colonies consisting of immense tunnel complexes in secluded mountain ranges. The largest gnome settlement on Krynn, beneath Mount Nevermind, is home to some 59,000 tinkers. Other tinker gnome colonies exist, both on Krynn and elsewhere, but their populations seldom exceed 200-400.</p>
					<p>All tinkers have a Life Quest: to attain perfect understanding of a single device. Few ever actually attain this goal, but their individual Life Quests do keep the ever hopeful tinkers busy. Males and females are equal in tinker society, and each pursue Life Quests with similar devotion. Each tinker gnome belongs to a guild. The guild occupies the same place in a tinker's life that the clan occupies for other gnomes. Together the guildmasters make up a grand council that governs the community.</p>
					<p>Though most tinker gnomes are content to stay home and tinker with their projects, some have Life Quests which require them to venture out into the world. Adventuring gnomes are generally unable to learn from past experience and repeat the same mistakes, yet they are often successful with quirky solutions to save the day for their companions.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Despite their great friendliness, tinker gnomes are not well-liked by other races: their technological bent makes them quite alien to those accustomed to magic, and their poor understanding of social relations puts off many potential friends. Sages generally agree that the tinkers' indiscriminate trumpeting of technology has discouraged its development by other races who have encountered tinker gnomes.</p>

					<p>Shy and elusive, the forest gnomes live deep in forests and shun contact with other races except in times of dire emergencies threatening their beloved woods. The smallest of all the gnomes, they average 2 to 21/2 feet in height, with bark-colored, gray-green skin, dark hair, and blue, brown, or green eyes. A very long-lived people, they have an average life expectancy of 500 years.</p>
					<p>In addition to their own gnomish dialect, most forest gnomes can speak gnome common (rock gnome), Elf, Treant, and a simple language that enables them to communicate on a very basic level with forest animals. All forest gnomes have the innate ability to <i>pass without trace </i>, hide in woodlands (90% chance of success), and the same saving throw bonus as their rock gnome cousins.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Forest gnomes prefer boobie traps and missile weapons to melee weapons when dealing with enemies. Due to size and quickness they receive a -4 bonus to Armor Class whenever they are fighting M- or L-sized opponents. Forest gnomes receive a +1 bonus to all attack and damage rolls when fighting orcs, lizardmen, troglodytes, or any creature which they have seen damage their forest.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Forest gnomes live in small villages of less than 100 gnomes, each family occupying a large, hollowed-out tree. Most of these villages are disguised so well that even an elf or a ranger could walk through one without realizing it.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Forest gnomes are guardians of the woods and friends to the animals that live there. They will often help lost travellers but will strive to remain unseen while doing so.</p>

					<p>These small, evil humanoids would be merely pests, if not for their great numbers.</p>
					<p>Goblins have flat faces, broad noses, pointed ears, wide mouths and small, sharp fangs. Their foreheads slope back, and their eyes are usually dull and glazed. They always walk upright, but their arms hang down almost to their knees. Their skin colors range from yellow through any shade of orange to a deep red. Usually a single tribe has members all of about the same color skin. Their eyes vary from bright red to a gleaming lemon yellow. They wear clothing of dark leather, tending toward dull soiled-looking colors.</p>
					<p>Goblin speech is harsh, and pitched higher than that of humans. In addition to their own language, some goblins can speak in the kobold, orc, and hobgoblin tongues.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Goblins hate bright sunlight, and fight with a -1 on their attack rolls when in it. This unusual sensitivity to light, however, serves the goblins well underground, giving them infravision out to 60 feet.</p>
					<p>They can use any sort of weapon, preferring those that take little training, like spears and maces. They are known to carry short swords as a second weapon. They are usually armored in leather, although the leaders may have chain or even plate mail.</p>
					<p>Goblin strategies and tactics are simple and crude. They are cowardly and will usually avoid a face-to-face fight. More often than not, they will attempt to arrange an ambush of their foes.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Humans would consider the caves and underground dwellings of goblins to be dank and dismal. Those few tribes that live above ground are found in ruins, and are only active at night or on very dark, cloudy days. They use no form of sanitation, and their lairs have a foul stench. Goblins seem to be somewhat <b><u>resistant to the diseases that breed in such filth </u></b>.</p>
					<p>They live a communal life, sharing large common areas for eating and sleeping. Only leaders have separate living spaces. All their possessions are carried with them. Property of the tribe is kept with the chief and sub-chiefs. Most of their goods are stolen, although they do manufacture their own garments and leather goods. The concept of privacy is largely foreign to goblins.</p>
					<p>A typical goblin tribe has 40-400 (4d10x10) adult male warriors. For every 40 goblins there will be a leader and his 4 assistants, each having 1 Hit Die (7 hit points). For every 200 goblins there will be a sub-chief and 2-8 (2d4) bodyguards, each of which has 1+1 Hit Dice (8 hit points), is Armor Class 5, and armed with a battle axe. The tribe has a single goblin chief and 2-8 (2d4) bodyguards each of 2 Hit Dice, Armor Class 4, and armed with two weapons.</p>
					<p>There is a 25% chance that 10% of their force will be mounted upon huge worgs, and have another 10-40 (1d4x10) unmounted worgs with them. There is a 60% chance that the lair is guarded by 5-30 (5d6) such wolves, and a 20% chance of 2-12 (2d6) bugbears. Goblin shamans are rare, but have been known to reach 7th level. Their spheres include: Divination, Healing (reversed), Protection, and Sun (reversed). In addition to the males, there will be adult females equal to 60% of their number and children equal to the total number of adults in the lair. Neither will fight in battles.</p>
					<p>A goblin tribe has an exact pecking order; each member knows who is above him and who is below him. They fight amongst themselves constantly to move up this social ladder.</p>
					<p>They often take slaves for both food and labor. The tribe will have slaves of several races numbering 10-40% of the size of the tribe. Slaves are always kept shackled, and are staked to a common chain when sleeping.</p>
					<p>Goblins hate most other humanoids, gnomes and dwarves in particular, and work to exterminate them whenever possible.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Goblins live only 50 years or so. They do not need to eat much, but will kill just for the pleasure of it. They eat any creature from rats and snakes to humans. In lean times they will eat carrion.</p>
					<p>Goblins usually spoil their habitat, driving game from it and depleting the area of all resources. They are decent miners, able to note new or unusual construction in an underground area 25% of the time, and any habitat will soon be expanded by a maze-like network of tunnels.</p>

					<p>Gorgons are fierce, bull-like beasts who make their lairs in dreary caverns or the fastness of a wilderness. They are aggressive by nature and usually attack any creature or person they encounter.</p>
					<p>Monstrous black bulls, gorgons have hides of thick metal scales. Their breath is a noxious vapor that billows forth in great puffs from their wide, bull nostrils. Gorgons walk on two hooves, when necessary, but usually assume a four-hoofed stance. Despite their great size, they can move through even heavy forests with incredible speed, for they simply trample bushes and splinter smaller trees. Gorgons speak no languages but let out a roar of anger whenever they encounter other beings.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Four times per day gorgons can make a breath weapon attack (their preferred means of attack). Their breath shoots forth in a truncated cone, five feet wide at the base and 20 feet wide at its end, with a maximum range of 60 feet. <b><u>Any creature caught in this cone must roll a saving throw vs. petrification </u></b>. Those who fail are turned to stone immediately! The awareness of gorgons extends into the Astral and Ethereal planes, as do the effects of their breath weapon.</p>
					<p>If necessary (i.e., their breath weapon fails) gorgons will engage in melee, charging forward to deliver a vicious head butt or horn gore. Gorgons fight with unrestricted ferocity, slashing and trampling all who challenge them until they themselves are slain.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>It is believed that gorgons can actually devour the living statues they create with their breath weapon. Whether their flat iron teeth break up and pulverize the stone or their saliva returns the victim to flesh while they eat is a matter for conjecture.</p>
					<p>Their primary prey are deer and elk, but gorgons won't hesitate to add other meats to their diet when hungry. Their sense of smell is acute and once they get on the trail gorgons are 75% likely to track their victim successfully. Once their victim is in sight, gorgons let out a scream of rage and then charge. Unless somehow evaded, a gorgon will pursue tirelessly, for days if necessary, until the prey either drops from exhaustion or is caught in the gorgon's deadly breath.</p>
					<p>Gorgons have no use for treasure, hence gold and gems are often left petrified on the statue of the being that once wore them. Occasionally a gorgon in his haste will devour something of value; the items will later be left in the gorgon's droppings, somewhere near the entrance to its lair.</p>
					<p>Gorgons are usually encountered in groups of three or four - one male bull with two or three females. Gorgon calves are raised by the females to the age of two, then the young bulls are turned out to make their own way. Females remain with the dominant bull.</p>
					<p>About 25% of the time only a single gorgon is encountered. Lone gorgons are always rogue males in search of females.</p>
					<p>The forest around a gorgon lair is usually a crisscrossing network of trails and paths they've made. Occasionally there are clearings where the grasses were trampled down in a battle and perhaps the shattered remains of a statue can be found.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Gorgons have no natural enemies other than themselves. Bull gorgons are often called upon to defend their positions against rogue gorgons. These battles are not usually fatal, but even a gorgon can be felled by a well-aimed horn gore. The only other creature known to hunt these fierce predators is man.</p>
					<p>Gorgon blood, properly prepared, can seal an area against ethereal or astral intrusion; their powdered scales are an ingredient in the ink used to create a <i>protection from petrification </i>scroll.</p>
					<p>In addition, the hide of a gorgon can be fashioned, with considerable work and some magical enhancement, into a fine set of scale mail. <b><u>This armor will provide the wearer with a +2 bonus to all saving throws vs. petrification or flesh-to-stone spells </u></b>.</p>

					<p>Half-lion, half-eagle, griffons are ferocious avian carnivores that prey upon horses and their kin (hippogriffs, pegasi, and unicorns). This hunger for horseflesh often brings griffons into direct conflict with humans and demihumans.</p>
					<p>Adult griffons stand five feet at the shoulder and weigh over half a ton. Their head, upper torso, and forelegs are like those of a giant eagle. This eagle half is covered in golden feathers from its wing tips to its razor-sharp beak. Their powerful forelimbs end in long, hooked talons. Wings, with a span of 25 feet or more, rise out of their backs. The lower half of a griffon is that of a lion. Dusky yellow fur covers the lion half's muscular rear legs and clawed feet. A lion's tail hangs down from the griffon's powerful rear haunches. Griffons speak no languages, but emit an eagle-like screech when angered or excited (usually by the smell of horse).</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Griffons hunt in groups of 12 or less, searching the plains and forests near (within 20 miles) their lair for horses and herd animals. With their superior vision and sense of smell, griffons can spot prey up to two miles distant. If the prey is horse or horse-kin, griffons are 90% likely to attack even if the horses have riders. Griffons hunt only for food, so a rider who releases one or two horses can usually escape unharmed (though in all likelihood his horse won't). Any attempt to protect a horse brings the full fury of the attacking griffons on the protector.</p>
					<p>When attacking ground targets, griffons use their great size and weight to swoop down from above and raking their opponent with the talons before landing nearby. Griffons always fight to the death if there is horseflesh at stake.</p>
					<p>In aerial combat, griffons are equally fierce, lunging into battle and tearing at their opponent until they or their prey are dead. Many a griffon has plummeted to its death with a struggling hippogriff caught firmly in its grasp.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Griffons prefer rocky habitats, near open plains. Once griffons establish their territory, they remain until the food supply has been exhausted.</p>
					<p>Griffons, like lions, live in prides, with each pride comprising several mated pairs, their young, and one dominant male. The dominant male is responsible for settling territorial disputes with other prides and choosing the direction the hunt will take.</p>
					<p>Each pair of mated griffons in the pride has its own nest, located near the pride's other lairs. Griffon nests are usually situated in shallow caves, high along a cliff face.</p>
					<p>The nests are made of sticks and leaves, as well as an occasional bone. Griffons collect no treasure, but their caves frequently contain the remains of unfortunate travelers who tried to protect their horses from the griffons.</p>
					<p>During spring, female griffons lay one or two eggs that hatch in the late summer. For the first three months griffon young are known as hatchlings; thereafter, until they mature the young are called fledglings. Griffon young grow rapidly for three years until they are large enough to hunt with the pride. Adult griffons are extremely protective of their young and attack without mercy any creature that approaches within 100 feet of the nest.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>If trained from a very early age (three years or less), griffons will serve as mounts. The training, however, is both time-consuming and expensive, requiring the expertise of an animal trainer for two years. Once trained, though, griffons make fierce and loyal steeds, bonding with one master for life, and protecting him even unto death. A griffon mount knows no fear in battle, but attacks any horse or horse-kin in preference to other opponents.</p>
					<p>Acquiring a griffon fledgling is a very dangerous venture as the adults never stray far from the nest and fight to the death to defend eggs or young. Any given griffon nest is 75% likely to contain one or two fledglings or eggs. Fledgling griffons sell for 5,000 gold pieces on the open market; eggs sell for 2,000 gold pieces each.</p>

					<p>Powerfully-built humanoids clad only in dark, filthy rags, these warlike subterranean creatures emerge from their deep caverns at night to search for unlucky humans to add to their larders.</p>
					<p>Grimlocks have thick, scaly, grey skin and long, black, filthy hair. Their teeth are white and extremely sharp. Their eyes are blank white orbs.</p>
					<p>Grimlocks are totally blind, but have highly developed senses of smell and hearing. Their sensitive ears and noses combine to allow them to distinguish objects and creatures within 20', just as well as if they were able to see.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Grimlocks are <b><u>immune to the effects of spells which affect the vision </u></b>. These include <i>phantasmal force </i>, <i>darkness </i>, <i>invisibility </i>, <i>mirror image </i>, and many others. However, spells such as <i>audible glamer </i>, or any loud, continuous noise will partially 'blind' them. This reduces their ability to perceive opponents to a 10' range and makes them -2 on their attack rolls. Substances such as snuff or strong perfumes will have much the same effect if inhaled by a grimlock or thrown in its face.</p>
					<p>Grimlocks attack fiercely, but with little or no organization, often stopping in the middle of battle to carry off fallen foes or comrades for food. For every 10 grimlocks encountered, there will be a leader of 3 Hit Dice and AC 4, for every 40 there will be a champion of 4 Hit Dice and AC 3. These exceptional individuals will usually be the only ones to show even the most elemental strategy, usually by allowing their followers to weaken opponents before entering battle themselves.</p>
					<p>Grimlocks will nearly always attack in darkness if possible. While not adversely affected by light, they are intelligent enough to realize that in total darkness, their unique form of perception gives them a distinct advantage.</p>
					<p>Though able to attack with their hands (for 1-6 hp damage), grimlocks prefer edged weapons and will usually (90% chance) be armed as follows: hand-axe, 20%; battle-axe, 15%; two-handed sword, 15%; bastard sword, 15%; broad sword, 15%; long sword, 20%. Leaders or champions will always be armed with a battle-axe or two-handed sword.</p>
					<p>Grimlocks, whether normal, leader, or champion, make all saving throws as 6th-level fighters. Grimlocks gain a +1 on surprise rolls, since their acute hearing allows them to communicate in voices too faint for other races to hear. In addition, their morale is raised by 1 for every leader or champion with the group.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Grimlocks lair in vast cavern complexes in mountainous areas. They are well adapted to these environs. In any rocky terrain they blend in so well that, while motionless, they are completely undetectable - unless one actually bumps into them. In any grimlock lair, there will be nearly as many females (1 Hit Die and AC 6) as males, and at least as many young (1 hit point, AC 6 and non-combatant). Grimlock leaders and champions do wield some control over these communities.</p>
					<p>However, this control is usually effective only as long as the leader who gave the order is around to enforce his will. It is nearly impossible for those of other races to tell one grimlock from another - although leader types may appear slightly larger - but they easily tell each other apart by subtle differences in scent and movement.</p>
					<p>Extremely xenophobic, grimlocks rarely consort with other races. However, there is a small (10%) chance that they will allow medusae to share their lairs, and a 2% chance that any wandering group will be accompanied by 1-2 mind flayers.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Grimlocks will only eat the raw flesh of humanoid creatures, vastly preferring that of humans to all others. Foraging parties often raid the homes of other subterranean races, especially those who keep large slave populations (such as drow). They are often on good terms with mind flayers since illithids have a large supply of humanoid bodies discarded after they have devoured the brains. Grimlocks are particularly hated by githyanki for this reason. Since the slave flesh the grimlocks often consume (raw) is frequently unwholesome, whole communities are often decimated by disease.</p>

					<p>A spectral hag is the undead spirit of a hag who died during an evil ceremony. Returned to a mockery of the life she once knew, the hag is doomed to inhabit desolate places and seeks only to slaughter all she encounters. Though she retains many of her dread powers and is gifted with those of a spectre as well, she is a miserable creature who hates all life and light.</p>
					<p>Spectral hags are translucent reflections of their living forms. All have scraggly hair, withered faces, blackened teeth, and flesh covered with moles and warts. They wear the tottered and filthy garb of peasant women.</p>
					<p>As a rule, spectral hags speak common and one or two other languages.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Spectral hags have a Strength score of 18/00, adding +3 to their Attack Rolls and +6 to their Damage Rolls. Their chilling touch does <b>1d8 points of damage </b>and drains two life energy levels from the victim of the attack. Any being totally drained of life energy by one of these foul hags becomes a full-strength spectre under the control of the crone, In general, any encounter with one of these creatures will also include 3d6 spectres who represent the past enemies of the shrew.</p>
					<p>Spectral hags can only be hit by <b><u>+1 or better weapons and are immune to all </u></b><b><i><u>sleep </u></i></b><b><u>, </u></b><b><i><u>charm </u></i></b><b><u>, </u></b><b><i><u>hold </u></i></b><b><u>, and cold-based spells </u></b>. Similarly, poisons, disease, and paralyzation cannot harm them.</p>
					<p>Being undead, these creatures are subject to the turning ability of priests and paladins. <b><u>Holy water inflicts 2d4 points of damage </u></b><u>per vial splashed upon them and a </u><i><u>raise dead </u></i><u>spell destroys the hag immediately if a saving throw vs. spell is failed and the creature's natural magic resistance is overcome </u>. Daylight makes them powerless by weakening their ties to the Negative Material plane, although it does not actually harm them.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Although they are usually solitary creatures, there is a chance that any spectral hag who was a member of a covey in life will retain contact with her foul sisters. Indeed, if all were killed while engaged in an evil ceremony, the dark trio might all have attained undead stature and present an even more deadly force for adventurers to deal with. If one member of a covey was killed and later slew her sisters, she is the feaster and the other two are under her control.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Though partially insubstantial, spectral hags still crave humanoid flesh. The fact that they can neither taste nor consume this vile delicacy causes them no end of suffering.</p>
					<p><b>Annis</b></p>
					<p>The spectral annis is certainly the most terrible of these creatures. In addition to all the powers she had when living, this undead horror has acquired the power to conduct a dark ceremony on the night of the new moon which transforms any single female captive into a living annis under her command. Being utterly evil, these hags use this power to cause as much suffering to the living as they can.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Green Hag</b></p>
					<p>Like annis, green hags who become undead acquire the ability to perform a sinister ceremony by which they create more of their living sisters. In the case of these foul crones, the victim is a young elf woman and the ceremony must be held by the light of the full moon.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Sea Hag</b></p>
					<p>As with the other dark sisters, spectral sea hags are able to transform the innocent into wretches like themselves. When a sea hag wishes to employ this power, she seeks out a halfling, gnome, or dwarf woman. When the moon slips into an eclipse, the sea hag holds her foul ritual and the helpless captive becomes like her, condemned to an existence of horror and misery.</p>

					<p>Hags are witchlike beings that spread havoc and destruction, working their magics, and slaying all whom they encounter.</p>
					<p>Hags appear as wretched old women, with long, frayed hair and withered faces. Horrid moles and warts dot their blotchy skin, their mouths are filled with blackened teeth, and their breath is most foul. Though wrinkled and skinny, hags possess supernatural strength and can easily crush smaller creatures, such as goblins, with one hand. Similarly, though hags look decrepit, they run swiftly, easily bounding over rocks or logs in their path. From the long, skinny fingers of hags grow iron-like claws. Hags use these claws (and their supernatural strength) to rend and tear at opponents in combat. Their garb is similar to that of peasant women, but usually much more tattered and filthy.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>The combat abilities of hags vary with each type (see below for details), but all hags possess the following: 18/00 Strength or greater, some level of magic resistance, and the spell-like ability to <i>change self </i>at will. Hags use this last ability to attract victims, frequently posing as young human or demihuman females, helpless old women, or occasionally as orcs or hobgoblins. A disguised hag reveals her true form and leaps to the attack when weak opponents come near. Against well armed and armored parties, hags maintain their disguise and employ further trickery designed to place the intended victim in a more vulnerable position. This trickery can take any of several forms, including verbal persuasion, leading the victim into a prearranged trap, and so on.</p>
					<p>The one weakness of hags is their arrogance. Hags have great disdain for the mental abilities of all humans and demihumans and, though hags are masterful employers of disguise, clever characters may be able to glean a hag's true nature through conversation.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Hags live alone or in coveys of three. They always choose desolate, out-of-the-way places in which to dwell. They sometimes coexist with ogres or evil giants. The former act as servants or guards for hags, but giants are treated with respect (for obvious reasons) and often cooperate with hags to accomplish acts of great evil against the outside world.</p>
					<p>While individually powerful, hags are much more dangerous when formed into a covey. A covey is composed of three hags of any combination (e.g., two annis and a green hag, three annis, etc.). Coveys have special powers that individual hags don't possess. These powers include the following spells: <i>curse </i>, <i>polymorph other </i>, <i>animate dead </i>, <i>dream </i>, <i>control weather </i>, <i>veil </i>, <i>forcecage </i>, <i>vision </i>, and <i>mind blank </i>. Covey spells can each be used once per day, and take effect as if they were cast by a 9th-level spellcaster. To cast one of these spells, the members of the covey must all be within 10 feet of each other and the spell being cast must be in lieu of all other attacks.</p>
					<p>Coveys never cast these spells in combat, instead these spells are used to help weave wicked plots against neighboring human or demihuman settlements. A common ploy by coveys is to force or trick a victim into performing some heinous deed. This deed usually involves bringing back more victims, some of whom are devoured by the hags; the rest are used on further evil assignments. Any creature fortunate (or unfortunate) enough to resist a covey is immediately devoured.</p>
					<p>A covey of hags is 80% likely to be guarded by a mixture of 1d8 ogres and 1d4 evil giants. Coveys often use one or two of their ogres as spies, sending them into the world beyond after polymorphing them into less threatening creatures.</p>
					<p>These minions frequently (60%) wear a special magical gem called a <i>hag eye </i>. A <i>hag eye </i>is made from the real eye of a covey's previous victim. It appears to the casual observer to be no more than a low-value gem (20 gp or less), but if viewed through a <i>gem of true seeing </i>, a disembodied eye can be seen trapped in the <i>hag eye </i>'s interior. This hidden eye is magically connected to the covey that created the hag eye. All three members of the covey can see whatever the <i>hag eye </i>is pointed at. <i>Hag eyes </i>are usually placed on a medallion or brooch worn by one of the hag's polymorphed servants. Occasionally <i>hag eyes </i>are given as gifts to unsuspecting victims whom the hags want to monitor. Destroying a <i>hag eye </i>inflicts <b>1d10 points of damage </b>to each member of the covey that created it, and one of the three hags is struck blind for 24 hours.</p>
					<p>Hags commonly inhabit bone-strewn glens deep within forests. There is an 80% chance that hags are keeping one or two captives in a nearby earthen pit or <i>forcecage </i>. These prisoners are held for a purpose known only to the hags themselves, though it will certainly involve spreading chaos into the outside world. Prisoners kept in a pit are guarded by an evil giant or one to two ogres; those in a <i>forcecage </i>are left alone.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Hags have a ravenous appetite and are able to devour man-sized creatures in just 10 rounds. They prefer human flesh, but settle for orc or demihuman when necessary. This wanton destruction has earned hags some powerful enemies. Besides humanity in general, both good giants and good dragons hunt hags, slaying them whenever possible. Still, hags multiply rapidly by using their <i>change self </i>ability to appear as beautiful maidens to men they encounter alone. Hag offspring are always female. Legends say that hags can change their unborn child for that of a human female while she sleeps. They further state that any mother who brings such a child to term is then slain by the hag-child she carries. Fortunately, such ghastly tales have never been proven.</p>
					<p>Hags hoard fine treasure, using the jewelry and coins to decorate the bones of their more powerful victims, and the finer gems (500 gp value or higher) to manufacture magical <i>hag eyes </i>.</p>
					<p><b>Annis</b></p>
					<p>The largest and most powerful of all the hags, annis stand seven to eight feet tall. Their skin is deep blue in complexion, while their hair, teeth, and nails are glossy black. The eyes of an annis are dull green or yellow. Annis have normal infravision (60-foot range), but superior hearing and sense of smell. Annis are surprised only on a 1 on 1d10.</p>
					<p>An annis attacks using its talons and teeth to inflict horrible wounds. In melee, annis tend to close and grapple. An annis that hits an opponent with all three of its attacks in one round has successfully grappled its opponent. Next round, all attacks by the annis are automatic hits, unless the opponent is stronger, the annis is slain, or the victim uses some magical means to escape the hag. Otherwise, the annis will continue to hold the victim in its grasp, and deliver damage with its raking talons and sharpened teeth each round until the victim is slain.</p>
					<p>In addition to normal attacks, annis have the ability to cast <i>fog cloud </i>three times per day. This spell is used to confuse resistance or to delay attack by a superior foe. Annis can also <i>change self </i>like all hags, appearing as a tall human, ogre, or even a small giant. These spells are cast at 8th level for purposes of determining spell range, duration, etc.</p>
					<p>The skin of an annis is iron-hard; thus edged weapons cause 1 less point of damage when they hit these hags. Conversely, blunt weapons (including morning stars) cause 1 additional point of damage against an annis.</p>
					<p>Annis speak their own language, as well as ogre, all evil giant tongues, and some common. Some of the most intelligent annis can speak common fluently and know a smattering of various demihuman languages. Annis are believed to live for 500 years.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Greenhag</b></p>
					<p>These wretched creatures live in desolate countryside and amid dense forests and swamps. Greenhags, as their name implies, have a sickly green pallor. Hair color ranges from near black to olive green, and their eyes are amber or orange. Their skin appears withered but is hard and rough like the bark of a tree. Due to their coloration and their ability to move with absolute silence, greenhags impose a -5 penalty to an opponent's surprise roll when in a forest or swamp. They have superior hearing, smell, and sight, including infravision (90-foot range). They are only surprised on a roll of 1 on the 1d10 surprise roll.</p>
					<p>Rock-hard talons grow from the long, slender fingers of greenhags. They use these talons to slash and rend their opponents. Smaller than their annis cousins, greenhags nonetheless possess Strength equivalent to that of an ogre (18/00). Because of their great Strength, all their attack rolls gain a +3 bonus and all hits receive a +6 damage bonus.</p>
					<p>Greenhags can cast the following spells at will, one spell per round: <i>audible glamor </i>, <i>dancing lights </i>, <i>invisibility </i>, <i>pass without trace </i>, <i>change self </i>, <i>speak with monsters </i>, <i>water breathing </i>, and <i>weakness </i>. Each spell is employed at 9th level of ability.</p>
					<p>To lure victims, greenhags typically use their <i>mimic </i>ability. This enables them to imitate the voice of a mature or immature male or female, human or demihuman. Calls for help and crying are common deceptions employed by greenhags. They are also able to mimic most animals.</p>
					<p>Greenhags speak their own language (a dialect of annis) as well as all demihuman languages and common. These are the longest lived of all hags - they can live for up to 1,000 years.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Sea Hag</b></p>
					<p>These, the most wretched of all hags, inhabit thickly vegetated shallows in warm seas and, very rarely, overgrown lakes. Warts, bony protrusions, and patches of slimy green scales dot their sickly yellow skin. Their eyes are always red with deep, black pupils. Long, seaweed-like hair hangs limply from their heads, covering their withered bodies.</p>
					<p>Sea hags hate beauty, attempting to destroy it wherever it is encountered. Sea hags can change self at will, and often use this ability to draw their victims within 30 feet before revealing themselves. <b><u>The true appearance of a sea hag is so ghastly that anyone viewing one of these hags grows weak from fright unless a successful saving throw vs. spell is rolled </u></b>. Beings that fail their saving throw lose 1/2 of their Strength for 1d6 turns. Worse still, sea hags can cast a deadly glance up to three times a day. This look affects one creature of the sea hag's choosing within 30 feet. <b><u>To negate the effects of this glance, the victim must successfully save vs. poison </u></b>. If the saving throw is failed, the victim either dies immediately from fright (25% chance) or falls stricken and is paralyzed for three days (75% chance). Few who survive the glance live to tell of it, for sea hags quickly devour their helpless victims.</p>
					<p>Sea hags always use their deadly glance as their primary form of attack; they will melee, but only if they have the advantage of numbers. Unlike other hags, sea hags use daggers in combat, receiving a +3 bonus to their attack roll and a +6 damage bonus, due to their ogre-like Strength.</p>
					<p>Sea hags speak their own language as well as common and the languages of annis, and sea elves, and live for 800 years.</p>

Still, hags multiply rapidly by using their <i>change self </i>ability to appear as beautiful maidens to men they encounter alone. Hag offspring are always female. Legends say that hags can change their unborn child for that of a human female while she sleeps. They further state that any mother who brings such a child to term is then slain by the hag-child she carries. Fortunately, such ghastly tales have never been proven.</p>
					<p>Hags hoard fine treasure, using the jewelry and coins to decorate the bones of their more powerful victims, and the finer gems (500 gp value or higher) to manufacture magical <i>hag eyes </i>.</p>
					<p><b>Annis</b></p>
					<p>The largest and most powerful of all the hags, annis stand seven to eight feet tall. Their skin is deep blue in complexion, while their hair, teeth, and nails are glossy black. The eyes of an annis are dull green or yellow. Annis have normal infravision (60-foot range), but superior hearing and sense of smell. Annis are surprised only on a 1 on 1d10.</p>
					<p>An annis attacks using its talons and teeth to inflict horrible wounds. In melee, annis tend to close and grapple. An annis that hits an opponent with all three of its attacks in one round has successfully grappled its opponent. Next round, all attacks by the annis are automatic hits, unless the opponent is stronger, the annis is slain, or the victim uses some magical means to escape the hag. Otherwise, the annis will continue to hold the victim in its grasp, and deliver damage with its raking talons and sharpened teeth each round until the victim is slain.</p>
					<p>In addition to normal attacks, annis have the ability to cast <i>fog cloud </i>three times per day. This spell is used to confuse resistance or to delay attack by a superior foe. Annis can also <i>change self </i>like all hags, appearing as a tall human, ogre, or even a small giant. These spells are cast at 8th level for purposes of determining spell range, duration, etc.</p>
					<p>The skin of an annis is iron-hard; thus edged weapons cause 1 less point of damage when they hit these hags. Conversely, blunt weapons (including morning stars) cause 1 additional point of damage against an annis.</p>
					<p>Annis speak their own language, as well as ogre, all evil giant tongues, and some common. Some of the most intelligent annis can speak common fluently and know a smattering of various demihuman languages. Annis are believed to live for 500 years.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Greenhag</b></p>
					<p>These wretched creatures live in desolate countryside and amid dense forests and swamps. Greenhags, as their name implies, have a sickly green pallor. Hair color ranges from near black to olive green, and their eyes are amber or orange. Their skin appears withered but is hard and rough like the bark of a tree. Due to their coloration and their ability to move with absolute silence, greenhags impose a -5 penalty to an opponent's surprise roll when in a forest or swamp. They have superior hearing, smell, and sight, including infravision (90-foot range). They are only surprised on a roll of 1 on the 1d10 surprise roll.</p>
					<p>Rock-hard talons grow from the long, slender fingers of greenhags. They use these talons to slash and rend their opponents. Smaller than their annis cousins, greenhags nonetheless possess Strength equivalent to that of an ogre (18/00). Because of their great Strength, all their attack rolls gain a +3 bonus and all hits receive a +6 damage bonus.</p>
					<p>Greenhags can cast the following spells at will, one spell per round: <i>audible glamor </i>, <i>dancing lights </i>, <i>invisibility </i>, <i>pass without trace </i>, <i>change self </i>, <i>speak with monsters </i>, <i>water breathing </i>, and <i>weakness </i>. Each spell is employed at 9th level of ability.</p>
					<p>To lure victims, greenhags typically use their <i>mimic </i>ability. This enables them to imitate the voice of a mature or immature male or female, human or demihuman. Calls for help and crying are common deceptions employed by greenhags. They are also able to mimic most animals.</p>
					<p>Greenhags speak their own language (a dialect of annis) as well as all demihuman languages and common. These are the longest lived of all hags - they can live for up to 1,000 years.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Sea Hag</b></p>
					<p>These, the most wretched of all hags, inhabit thickly vegetated shallows in warm seas and, very rarely, overgrown lakes. Warts, bony protrusions, and patches of slimy green scales dot their sickly yellow skin. Their eyes are always red with deep, black pupils. Long, seaweed-like hair hangs limply from their heads, covering their withered bodies.</p>
					<p>Sea hags hate beauty, attempting to destroy it wherever it is encountered. Sea hags can change self at will, and often use this ability to draw their victims within 30 feet before revealing themselves. <b><u>The true appearance of a sea hag is so ghastly that anyone viewing one of these hags grows weak from fright unless a successful saving throw vs. spell is rolled </u></b>. Beings that fail their saving throw lose 1/2 of their Strength for 1d6 turns. Worse still, sea hags can cast a deadly glance up to three times a day. This look affects one creature of the sea hag's choosing within 30 feet. <b><u>To negate the effects of this glance, the victim must successfully save vs. poison </u></b>. If the saving throw is failed, the victim either dies immediately from fright (25% chance) or falls stricken and is paralyzed for three days (75% chance). Few who survive the glance live to tell of it, for sea hags quickly devour their helpless victims.</p>
					<p>Sea hags always use their deadly glance as their primary form of attack; they will melee, but only if they have the advantage of numbers. Unlike other hags, sea hags use daggers in combat, receiving a +3 bonus to their attack roll and a +6 damage bonus, due to their ogre-like Strength.</p>
					<p>Sea hags speak their own language as well as common and the languages of annis, and sea elves, and live for 800 years.</p>

					<p>Halflings are a hard-working race of peaceful citizens. Their communities are similar to those of humans, although they usually contain many burrow homes in addition to surface cottages.</p>
					<p>Halflings average 3 feet in height, have ruddy complexions, with sandy to dark brown hair, and blue or hazel eyes. Their dress is often colorful but serviceable, and they like to wear caps or tunics. In addition to their own language, many halflings also speak the common tongue, gnome, goblin, and orcish.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Halflings will fight with great ferocity in defense of good or their homes. They are very skilled with both the sling and the bow (receiving a +3 bonus on all attack rolls) and use these weapons to great advantage in battle. Their tactics often involve feints to draw their attackers into the open where they can be subjected to a volley of fire from cover.</p>
					<p>When equipped for battle, halflings wear padded or leather armor. A halfling force is usually armed with short swords and hand axes. In addition, two-thirds of the halflings will be carrying either a sling or short bow.</p>
					<p>All halflings above normal level will have Armor Class 6, while those of 3rd or 4th level wear chain mail over their leather (AC 4). Higher level halflings have a 10 percent chance per level of having a magic weapon or armor.</p>
					<p>As all halflings are naturally <b><u>resistant to magic and poisons - they save at 4 levels above their actual level </u></b>. In addition, halflings are exceedingly clever at quiet movement and hiding. In combat, their opponents receive a -5 on their surprise roll. In natural terrain halflings are considered invisible when they are hiding in vegetation.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Halfling villages will generally have between 30 and 300 (30d10) individuals living in them. For every 30 halflings in a particular community there will be two 2nd-level fighters and a 3rd-level priest. If more than 90 halflings are encountered there will be an additional leader of 3rd-level fighting ability. If more than 150 are encountered there will also be the following additional halfling warriors in the group: one 9th-level fighter, two 4th-level fighters and three 3rd-level fighters. Further, a community of 150 halflings will have a 5th-level priest.</p>
					<p>Cheerful and outgoing, halflings, take great pleasure in simple crafts and nature. Their fingers, though short, are very dexterous allowing them to create objects of great beauty. Halflings shun water and extremes in temperature, preferring to settle in temperate pastoral countrysides. They get along well with humans and receive a +2 bonus to all their Reaction Rolls involving human NPCs.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Halflings hunt occasionally, but prefer breads, vegetables and fruits, with an occasional pheasant on the side. They have a life expectancy of 100 years on the average.</p>
					<p><b>Tallfellow</b></p>
					<p>A taller (4'+) and slimmer halfling with fair skin and hair, tallfellows are somewhat rare among the halfling folk. Tallfellows generally speak the language of elves in addition to those listed previously and greatly enjoy their company. In combat, tallfellows often ride ponies and carry spears or small lances. Tallfellows of strength 17 or more can rise to 6th level fighting ability. They live 180 years on average. Like elves, a tallfellow can recognize a secret door on a roll of 1 on a 1d6. All tallfellows receive a +2 bonus to surprise rolls when in forest or wooded terrain.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Stout</b></p>
					<p>These halflings are shorter and stockier than the more common hairfoots. Stouts take great pleasure in gems and fine masonry, often working as jewelers or stone cutters. They rarely mix with humans and elves, but enjoy the company of dwarves and often speak their language fluently. Like dwarves, stouts have infravision (60'), a 75% chance to detect sloping passageways, and a 50% chance of determining direction when underground. Stouts with a strength score of 17 or better can work their way up to the 9th-level of fighting ability. Their ties with the dwarven folk have spilled over into their combat tactics, with many stouts employing hammers and morningstars in combat. Stouts also have no fear of water and, in fact, many are excellent swimmers. Stouts can reach an age of 140 or more years.</p>

					<p>Halflings are a hard-working race of peaceful citizens. Their communities are similar to those of humans, although they usually contain many burrow homes in addition to surface cottages.</p>
					<p>Halflings average 3 feet in height, have ruddy complexions, with sandy to dark brown hair, and blue or hazel eyes. Their dress is often colorful but serviceable, and they like to wear caps or tunics. In addition to their own language, many halflings also speak the common tongue, gnome, goblin, and orcish.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Halflings will fight with great ferocity in defense of good or their homes. They are very skilled with both the sling and the bow (receiving a +3 bonus on all attack rolls) and use these weapons to great advantage in battle. Their tactics often involve feints to draw their attackers into the open where they can be subjected to a volley of fire from cover.</p>
					<p>When equipped for battle, halflings wear padded or leather armor. A halfling force is usually armed with short swords and hand axes. In addition, two-thirds of the halflings will be carrying either a sling or short bow.</p>
					<p>All halflings above normal level will have Armor Class 6, while those of 3rd or 4th level wear chain mail over their leather (AC 4). Higher level halflings have a 10 percent chance per level of having a magic weapon or armor.</p>
					<p>As all halflings are naturally <b><u>resistant to magic and poisons - they save at 4 levels above their actual level </u></b>. In addition, halflings are exceedingly clever at quiet movement and hiding. In combat, their opponents receive a -5 on their surprise roll. In natural terrain halflings are considered invisible when they are hiding in vegetation.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Halfling villages will generally have between 30 and 300 (30d10) individuals living in them. For every 30 halflings in a particular community there will be two 2nd-level fighters and a 3rd-level priest. If more than 90 halflings are encountered there will be an additional leader of 3rd-level fighting ability. If more than 150 are encountered there will also be the following additional halfling warriors in the group: one 9th-level fighter, two 4th-level fighters and three 3rd-level fighters. Further, a community of 150 halflings will have a 5th-level priest.</p>
					<p>Cheerful and outgoing, halflings, take great pleasure in simple crafts and nature. Their fingers, though short, are very dexterous allowing them to create objects of great beauty. Halflings shun water and extremes in temperature, preferring to settle in temperate pastoral countrysides. They get along well with humans and receive a +2 bonus to all their Reaction Rolls involving human NPCs.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Halflings hunt occasionally, but prefer breads, vegetables and fruits, with an occasional pheasant on the side. They have a life expectancy of 100 years on the average.</p>
					<p><b>Tallfellow</b></p>
					<p>A taller (4'+) and slimmer halfling with fair skin and hair, tallfellows are somewhat rare among the halfling folk. Tallfellows generally speak the language of elves in addition to those listed previously and greatly enjoy their company. In combat, tallfellows often ride ponies and carry spears or small lances. Tallfellows of strength 17 or more can rise to 6th level fighting ability. They live 180 years on average. Like elves, a tallfellow can recognize a secret door on a roll of 1 on a 1d6. All tallfellows receive a +2 bonus to surprise rolls when in forest or wooded terrain.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Stout</b></p>
					<p>These halflings are shorter and stockier than the more common hairfoots. Stouts take great pleasure in gems and fine masonry, often working as jewelers or stone cutters. They rarely mix with humans and elves, but enjoy the company of dwarves and often speak their language fluently. Like dwarves, stouts have infravision (60'), a 75% chance to detect sloping passageways, and a 50% chance of determining direction when underground. Stouts with a strength score of 17 or better can work their way up to the 9th-level of fighting ability. Their ties with the dwarven folk have spilled over into their combat tactics, with many stouts employing hammers and morningstars in combat. Stouts also have no fear of water and, in fact, many are excellent swimmers. Stouts can reach an age of 140 or more years.</p>

					<p>Harpies are wicked avian beasts that prey upon nearly all creatures but prefer the flesh of humans and demihumans.</p>
					<p>Harpies have the bodies of vultures but the upper torsos and heads of women. Their human features are youthful, but hideous, with frayed unkempt hair and decaying teeth. A foul odor surrounds all harpies and that which they touch. Harpies never bathe nor clean themselves in any way. Their dress, if anything, is limited to tattered rags and shiny trinkets taken from previous victims.</p>
					<p>The language of harpies, in contrast to their enticing song, is a horrible collection of cackles and shrieks. Although there are instances of harpies which could speak the languages of other creatures, these are few and far between.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>The song of the harpies has the ability to <i>charm </i>all humans and demihumans who hear it (elves are <b><u>resistant to the </u></b><b><i><u>charm </u></i></b><b><u>) </u></b>. <b><u>Those who fail their saving throw versus spell will proceed towards the harpy with all possible speed, only to stand entranced while the harpy slays them at its leisure </u></b>. This <i>charm </i>will last as long as the harpy continues to sing. Harpies can sing even while engaged in melee.</p>
					<p>It is impossible to fend off a harpy song simply by clasping hands over ears because the <i>charm </i>takes effect the moment the first note is heard. Characters making prior preparations to block out the sound, (wax in ears, etc.), are <b><u>immune to the effects of the song </u></b>. In addition, characters who make their saving throw are thereafter <b><u>immune to its effect, until such time as they encounter a different group of harpies </u></b>.</p>
					<p>If forced to fight, harpies can do so quite effectively by delivering a vicious bite and raking simultaneously with their talons. About 50% of all harpies encountered will use weapons, usually a bone club (damage 1-8) which they wield surprisingly well.</p>
					<p>The touch of a harpy upon a charmed individual has a similar, though somewhat less potent, effect. <b><u>Those who are touched and miss their saving throw versus spell will stand mesmerized for 20+1d10 hours </u></b>.</p>
					<p>The effect of either charm is broken if the harpy is slain.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Harpies make their home upon coastlines in regions near shipping lanes and by well-traveled paths. There they use their song to lure travelers to their doom.</p>
					<p>Their lair is usually a shallow cave, which they defile until no animal dare approach it. Here they remain unless hunting. Harpies often carry victims back to their lair to devour them in more familiar surroundings.</p>
					<p>Harpies have little use for treasure, other than the shiny baubles which they often attach to their clothes. Other items, such as gold and weapons, are frequently interspersed amongst the filth and bones that litter the cave. This refuse can reach a depth of several feet in the oldest of harpy lairs.</p>
					<p>A typical harpy lair houses about a half-dozen of these wretched creatures. No male harpies have ever been seen and it seems that harpies can reproduce at will by laying a single egg every other year. Harpies take no care of their young, which live off carcasses and cave vermin until they themselves are old enough to sing and hunt.</p>
					<p>Harpies have no social structure, frequently quarreling over who gets what part of a victim and when to stop the torturing and start the feasting. Occasionally these quarrels will turn violent, so that more than one harpy feast has begun with the last minute addition of the losing harpy to the menu.</p>
					<p>Harpies will occassionally agree to cooperate in evil acts with other humanoids.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Harpies hunt all manner of beasts, remaining in an area for as long as the food supply lasts. They are despised and greatly feared by all creatures weaker than themselves.</p>
					<p>Harpies have a voracious appetite, devouring all manner of man and beast. They take great delight in torture, and frequently kill for pleasure. Slain victims which harpies do not eat are simply left to rot. Their life span is unknown but seems to be about 50 years.</p>

					<p>Hawks are common throughout the world, from tropic to subarctic regions. They live mainly on vermin and rodents and thus are thought well of in many areas.</p>
					<p>Hawks are smaller than eagles. Their wingspan measures up to five feet from wing tip to wing tip. Coloration varies from species to species with red-brown to dark brown being most common.</p>
					<p>Large hawks have been known to attack small demihumans, through such occurrences are extremely rare.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Hawks attack via plummeting dives, usually from a height of 100 feet or more. This dive gives them a +2 bonus to their attack roll and their momentum enables their talons to inflict twice the normal damage. Hawks cannot attack with their beaks on the round they engage in a dive attack.</p>
					<p>After the initial dive, hawks fight by biting and pecking with their beaks and tearing at their opponents with their talons. Hawks always target wheezes and they have a 25% probability of striking an opponent's eye whenever their beaks hit. Opponents struck in the eye are blinded for 1d10 rounds and have a 10% chance of losing vision permanently in that eye. Because of their superior eyesight, hawks can never be surprised.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Hawks make their nests in tall trees or hidden among rocky slopes. There the female lays one to three eggs in early spring. The eggs hatch by summer's end and thereafter both the male and female work feeding the fledglings, beefing them up before winter arrives.</p>
					<p>During the fledglings' first nine months, one of the adult hawks is usually (80%) within sight of their nest. Any intruder threatening the nest is attacked if seen, regardless of size.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>If taken while young and trained by an expert, hawks can be taught to hunt. Because of this many animal trainers pay well for healthy fledglings. The price for a fledgling is about 500 gold pieces on the open market. Trained hawks sell for as much as 1.200 gold pieces each.</p>
					<p><b>Falcon</b></p>
					<p>Falcons are smaller, swifter, and more maneuverable than hawks. These birds of prey are more easily trained and are often preferred by hunters over hawks. Their nesting habits are similar to those of hawks, though many species roost underground. Trained falcons sell for around 1,000 gp each.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Blood Hawk</b></p>
					<p>Blood hawks resemble normal hawks in size alone, as their beaks are razor sharp and their talons unusually strong. Their feathersare a mottled grey. Large and powerfully built wings provide these killers with great speed and maneuverability when flying. These birds of prey hunt in small flocks and are fond of human flesh. They will continue to attack humans even if a melee is going against them and will break off very reluctantly.</p>
					<p>Male blood hawks kill humans not only for food but also for gems, with which they line their nests assn allurement to females. All other types of treasure are ignored by blood hawks.</p>

					<p>Hell hounds are fire-breathing canines from another plane of existence brought here in the service of evil beings.</p>
					<p>A hell hound resembles a large hound with rust-red or red-brown fur and red, glowing eyes. The markings, teeth, and tongue are soot black. It stands two to three feet high at the shoulder, and has a distinct odor of smoke and sulfur. The baying sounds it makes have an eerie, hollow tone that send a shiver through any who hear them.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Hell hounds are clever hunters that operate in packs. They do not bay like normal dogs while hunting. They move with great stealth, imposing a -5 penalty to opponents' surprise rolls. One or two of the pack sneak up on a quarry while the others form a ring around it. The first hell hound then springs from ambush, attacks the nearest victim, and attempts to drive the others toward the rest of the pack. If the prey does not run away, the rest of the pack closes in within 1d4+2 rounds. If hell hounds are pursuing fleeing prey, they might bay.</p>
					<p>Hell hounds attack first by breathing fire at an opponent up to 10 yards away. The fire causes 1 point of damage for each of the hell hound\xB7s Hit Dice. <b><u>A successful saving throw vs. breath weapon cuts the damage in half </u></b>. The hell hound then attacks with its teeth. The hell hound can continue to exhale flame while biting. If the hell hound rolls a natural 20 on its attack roll, it grabs a victim in its jaws and breathes fire on the victim.</p>
					<p>Hell hounds have a variety of defenses. They are <b><u>immune to fire </u></b>. Their keen hearing means they are surprised only on a 1 or 2 on 1d10. They can also see hidden or invisible creatures 50% of the time.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Hell hounds are native to those extradimensional planes notable for their hot, fiery landscapes. There they roam in packs of 2d20 beasts. The hell hounds on the Prime Material plane are summoned there to serve the needs of evil creatures. Most of them later escape to the wild.</p>
					<p>Hell hounds may have 4 to 7 (1d4+3) Hit Dice. The more Hit Dice a hell hound has, the larger it is and the more damage it causes. Each pack is led by a 7-Hit Die hell hound. The leader drives off other 7 HD rivals, who form their own packs.</p>
					<p>The diet of hell hounds is similar to that of normal canines. They roam a wide area of 1d10+4 square miles centered on their den. Pack territories may overlap.</p>
					<p>They do not easily reproduce on the Prime Material plane. Only 5% of encounters include puppies. Such puppies are born in litters of 2d4. They burp flame uncontrollably at least once a day. The flames are harmless aside from the tendency to set fire to anything flammable in the area. Newborn puppies are at 10% of the adult growth; they quickly grow an additional 5% each month and reach full adult growth (4 HD) in 11/2 years. While growing they can attack with their incendiary bite. Hell hound puppies up to two months old inflict 1 point of damage. Older ones add an additional 1 point for each additional six months of growth.</p>
					<p>Prey is usually eaten where it is slain, though hell hounds occasionally haul a carcass back to their den for later meals. Hell hounds are also similar to normal canines in that they may act as retrievers. Some objects are specifically sought; this is especially the case in trained hell hounds. Other hell hounds are simply playful and use the retrieved items as toys. They especially like noisy bags and pouches filled with their late victims' treasures. Flammable containers eventually burn and spill their contents in or around the den. Parchments are rarely found here unless protected by nonflammable containers.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Hell hounds have little place in the ecology of the normal world. They are dangerous annoyances prone to cause fires wherever they hunt. Hell hounds cause more forest fires than any other creature except for humanoids. Hell hounds have their uses, though. Because of their ability to easily detect hidden or invisible creatures, hell hounds make excellent watch dogs, especially for intelligent monsters such as fire giants.</p>
					<p>Hell hounds can be domesticated if raised from puppies, but there is a 10% chance each year that domesticated hell hounds go wild.</p>

					<p>Hippogriffs are flying monsters that have an equal likelihood to be predator, prey, or steed.</p>
					<p>The hippogriff is a monstrous hybrid of eagle and equine features. It has the ears, neck, mane, torso, and hind legs of a horse. The wings, forelegs, and face are those of an eagle. It is about the size of a light riding horse. A hippogriff may be colored russet, golden tan, or a variety of browns. The feathers are usually a different shade than the hide. The beak is ivory or golden yellow.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>The hippogriff attacks with its eagle-like claws and beak. Each claw can tear for <b>1d6 points of damage </b>, while the scissor-like beak inflicts <b>1d10 points of damage </b>.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Hippogriffs prefer the desolate sections of the temperate and tropic regions, especially rolling hills that enable them to get quickly airborne.</p>
					<p>Hippogriffs are territorial. They have a preferred grazing and hunting area that covers 1d4x10 square miles. Somewhere in this territory is a naturally protected site that serves as the hippogriff nest. Here is where the young hippogriffs stay. The nest is always guarded.</p>
					<p>The typical hippogriff herd includes 1-3 adult males, an equal number of mares, and the rest are immature young. There is a 25% chance that one or more of the mares is pregnant. Gestation takes 10 months. During the first five months, this occurs within the mare. Then she lays an egg that hatches in another five months. Twin births are rare (1% chance).</p>
					<p>The foal is able to walk upon hatching. Its beak remains soft for the first two weeks; this enables the foal to nurse. Then its beak hardens and the hippogriff switches to regurgitated food from its mother. The colts learn to eat solid meat at four months, although they are clumsy killers (-4 penalty to attack rolls and damage). At six months they can fly (18, class D) and fight with a -2 penalty to attack rolls and damage. Yearlings are identical to adults, although they are unable to breed until they are three years old.</p>
					<p>Wild hippogriffs are omnivorous. They feed on whatever is available, whether greenery, fruits, or wildlife. Hippogriffs are able to attack fairly large prey, such as bison, but they do not prey on carnivores. The exception is humanoids. Hippogriffs may, in the absence of other meat, attack small groups of people. Bodies are then carried back to the nest to feed the others; this is where the victim's possessions usually spill out. Hippogriffs are clean monsters; they dispose of carcasses and other debris by carrying them downhill. They like clear, sparkly things like glass, crystals, and precious gems. Males may amass a small trove kept covered by brush. As a mating ritual, he arranges these in a display to entice mares.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Hippogriffs are closely related to griffons. Just as griffons are the result of crossing an eagle with a lion, hippogriffs resulted from the crossing of an eagle with a horse. Hippogriffs may have been created as a natural prey for the griffons. Fortunately for the hippogriff, its own formidable weapons give it a fighting chance. To make up for the griffon's superiority, hippogriffs gather in larger groups.</p>
					<p>Hippogriffs are also related to pegasi. Because the hippogriffs eat meat, pegasi avoid their company.</p>
					<p>Hippogriffs make excellent flying mounts. The maneuverability decreases to Class D, but their speed is unimpaired. They are less likely to eat the rider than a griffon is.</p>
					<p>If a hippogriff is captured while still very young (under four months), it can be domesticated and trained to serve as a steed. Hippogriff eggs sell for 1,000 gp, young hippogriffs for 2,000-3,000 gp. It will probably have to be taught to fly. Domestic hippogriffs are also taught to recognize a limited number of species as food; humanoids of course are not on that list. Hippogriffs have difficulty breeding in captivity. Like flying, the wild hippogriff has to be captured before such skills are learned. Mature hippogriffs may be persuaded to voluntarily assist riders who can provide them with ample food or protection.</p>

							<p>. Swords are the most efficient weapons of ancient times, combining ease of use with excellent armor penetration. The earliest copper swords appeared thousands of years before the rise of the Roman Empire, and ceremonial swords are carried today by most of the world's armies and navies.</p>
							<p>Broadswords have existed in a number of settings. Any medium-sized blade designed for slashing can be called a broadsword. In ancient times, the best blades fall into this category; by the Middle Ages, this describes a civilian's sword or a court blade. Later broadswords were built with basket hilts, which give the weapon user a +1 bonus on any block attempts.</p>

					<p>Hobgoblins are a fierce humanoid race that wage a perpetual war with the other humanoid races. They are intelligent, organized, and aggressive.</p>
					<p>The typical hobgoblin is a burly humanoid standing 61/2' tall. Their hairy hides range from dark reddish-brown to dark gray. Their faces show dark red or red-orange skin. Large males have blue or red noses. Hobgoblin eyes are either yellowish or dark brown while their teeth are yellow. Their garments tend to be brightly colored, often bold, blood red. Any leather is always tinted black. Hobgoblin weaponry is kept polished and repaired.</p>
					<p>Hobgoblins have their own language and often speak with orcs, goblins, and carnivorous apes. Roughly 20% of them can speak the common tongue of man.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Hobgoblins in a typical force will be equipped with polearms (30%), morningstars (20%), swords and bows (20%), spears (10%), swords and spears (10%), swords and morning stars (5%), or swords and whips (5%).</p>
					<p>Hobgoblins fight equally well in bright light or virtual darkness, having infravision with a range of 60 feet.</p>
					<p>Hobgoblins hate elves and always attack them first.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Hobgoblins are nightmarish mockeries of the humanoid races who have a military society organized in tribal bands. Each tribe is intensely jealous of its status. Chance meetings with other tribes will result in verbal abuse (85%) or open fighting (15%). Hobgoblin tribes are found in almost any climate or subterranean realm.</p>
					<p>A typical tribe of hobgoblins will have between 20 and 200 (2d10x10) adult male warriors. In addition, for every 20 male hobgoblins there will be a leader (known as a sergeant) and two assistants. These have 9 hit points each but still fight as 1+1 Hit Die monsters. Groups numbering over 100 are led by a sub-chief who has 16 hit points and an Armor Class of 3. The great strength of a sub-chief gives it a +2 on its damage rolls and allows it to fight as a 3 Hit Die monster. If the hobgoblins are encountered in their lair, they will be led by a chief with AC 2, 22 hit points, and +3 points of damage per attack, who fights as a 4 Hit Die monster. The chief has 5-20 (5d4) sub-chiefs acting as bodyguards. Leaders and chiefs always carry two weapons.</p>
					<p>Each tribe has a distinctive battle standard which is carried into combat to inspire the troops. If the tribal chief is leading the battle, he will carry the standard with him, otherwise it will be held by one of his sub-chiefs.</p>
					<p>In addition to the warriors present in a hobgoblin tribe, there will be half again that many females and three times as many children as adult males.</p>
					<p>Fully 80% of all known hobgoblin lairs are subterranean complexes. The remaining 20% are surface villages which are fortified with a ditch, fence, 2 gates, and 3-6 guard towers. Villages are often built upon ruined humanoid settlements and may incorporate defensive features already present in the ruins.</p>
					<p>Hobgoblin villages possess artillery in the form of 2 heavy catapults, 2 light catapults, and a ballista for each 50 warriors. Underground complexes may be guarded by 2-12 carnivorous apes (60%).</p>
					<p>They are highly adept at mining and can detect new construction, sloping passages, and shifting walls 40% of the time.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Hobgoblins feel superior to goblins or orcs and may act as leaders for them. In such cases, the 'lesser races' are used as battle fodder. Hobgoblin mercenaries may work for powerful or rich evil humanoids.</p>
					<p><b>Koalinth</b></p>
					<p>This marine species of hobgoblin is similar to the land dwelling variety in many respects. Koalinth dwell in shallow fresh or salt water and make their homes in caves.</p>
					<p>Their bodies have adapted to marine environments via the evolution of gills. Their webbed fingers and toes give them a movement rate of 12 when swimming. Their bodies are sleeker than those of hobgoblins and they have light green skin. They speak an unusual dialect of the hobgoblin tongue.</p>
					<p>They tend to employ thrusting weapons like spears and pole arms. Koalinth are every bit as disagreeable as hobgoblins, preying on every thing they come across, especially aquatic humanoid and demi-human races. They detest aquatic elves.</p>

					<p>Homunculi are small mystical beings created by magicians for spying and other special tasks.</p>
					<p>The average homunculus is vaguely humanoid in form. It is 18 inches tall and its greenish, reptilian skin may have spots or warts. They have leathery, bat-like wings with a span of 24 inches and a mouth filled with long, pointed teeth that can inject a potent sleeping venom.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>The homonculous is a quick and agile flyer which uses this ability to great advantage in combat. It can dart to and fro so quickly that any attempt to capture it short of a net or web spell is almost impossible.</p>
					<p>In combat, the homunculus will land on its chosen victim and bite with its needle-like fangs. In addition to doing <b>1-3 points of damage </b>, the creature injects a powerful venom. <b><u>Anyone bitten by the homunculus must save vs. poison or fall into a comatose sleep for 5-30 (5d6) minutes </u></b>.</p>
					<p>The creature's saving throws are the same as those of its creator. While most attacks against either the homonculous or creator do not affect the other, there is one exception. Any attack which destroys the homonculous causes its creator to suffer 2-20 (2d10) points of damage. Conversely, if the creator is slain, the homonculous also dies and its body swiftly melts away into a pool of ichor.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Homonculi are artificial creatures created by wizards as living tools. The process by which one is created is long, complicated, and expensive. Any wizard who desires a homunculus servant must first locate and hire an alchemist. The wizard must provide one pint of his own blood and 500-2,000 (1d4x500) gold pieces. The blood becomes the basis for the creature's body while the money pays for a variety of other supplies and the alchemist's time. The alchemist requires 1-4 weeks to transform the blood into the necessary magical base. The wizard is then sent for and required to cast <i>mending </i>, <i>mirror image </i>, and <i>wizard eye </i>spells upon the fluids. As the last of these spells is worked, the fluids spontaneously coagulate and form the body of the homonculous.</p>
					<p>The homunculus is telepathically linked to its creator. It knows everything that its master knows and transmits everything it sees and hears to him. The creator can telepathically control the actions of the homunculus at a range of up to 480 yards. The homonculous will never willingly travel beyond the limits of contact with its master, though it can be removed from that region by force. As soon as it loses contact with its master, the creature panics and will do anything to regain contact. Contact between the two cannot be maintained across planar or dimensional barriers. If either the creator or homunculus is on another plane, the homunculus will remain near the point where it was last in contact with its master. Homunculi are a reflection of their creator. They have the creator's alignment, basic intelligence, and even physical mannerisms. They are mute but can write if the creator is literate. They may assist their creator in a variety of tasks including magical endeavors, although they cannot themselves cast spells.</p>
					<p>Homunculi lairs are in the homes of their creators. Indulgent wizards may provide a specially built bed, nest, or living chamber. Otherwise, the homonculous simply perches wherever it can.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Homunculi are nothing more than tools. They have no place in the natural world and are not part of any ecological system. They provide the wizard who created them with a variety of useful services. Commonly, a homunculus is called upon to act as a spy, scout, messenger, or emissary. Because of the potential harm which the death of a homonculous inflicts on its master, they are seldom employed as body guards or living weapons.</p>
					<p>Although they are magical creations, homunculi possess the same biological functions as non-magical creatures. They must rest and require food and drink in order to survive. When eating, they share the tastes of their masters and generally consume about as much as a typical cat.</p>
					<p>There are rumors of magical means by which non-wizards can acquire their own form of homunculus. Although these are not widely believed to be valid, there are those who report having seen the process or its results first hand. If such a procedure exists, it would be quite valuable to its discoverer.</p>

					<p>Giant hornets are nothing more than fantastically enlarged versions of normal insects. Unlike their more common cousins, they are often hostile and aggressive.</p>
					<p>The giant hornet has a 5' long body and a 10' wingspan. Their chitinous exoskeleton is marked by shiny, parallel stripes of black and yellow. The abdomen is tipped by a retractable stinger.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Giant hornets are solitary creatures who will attack on sight. It swoops down onto its prey and takes hold with its legs while its stinger stabs into the victim's body. In addition to inflicting <b>1-4 points of damage </b>, the stinger also injects a potent toxin. <b><u>If a saving throw versus poison is not made, the toxin does 5-30 points of damage </u></b><u>and paralyzes the victim for 2-12 (2d6) hours </u>.</p>
					<p>Smoke and flame are powerful weapons in any battle against these giant insects. Smoke causes them to become somewhat tranquilized, invoking a -2 penalty on its attack rolls. Flame frightens them greatly, and they will suffer a -4 on their attack rolls against anyone who is using it to defend himself. The hornet's wings are especially vulnerable to flame and will be consumed by any form of fire-based attack in one round. Although this does no physical harm to the hornet, it does render it flightless until its wings grow back in 2-12 (2d6) weeks.</p>
					<p>The giant hornet is a very noisy flier and the buzzing of its wings can be heard up to 150' away. Underground, this range is halved by each wall or closed door between the monster and the listener.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Giant hornets are believed to be the result of magical experiments gone awry. Save for the fact that they are much more aggressive than the common hornet, their gigantic size has not changed their instinctual behavior.</p>
					<p>Once per month, female hornets will prepare a nest and attract a male for mating. Together, the two create an egg chamber in some out of the way place. Egg clambers can be established in pits, abandoned buildings, caves, or any similar area. The wales of the chamber are coated with a mixture of mud, cellulose, and hornet saliva which hardens into rock. The construction of the chamber takes between 1 and 6 days, depending on its size.</p>
					<p>When the chamber is complete, the couple mates. The male departs shortly afterwards, but dies within a day from exhaustion. The female leaves the chamber in search of a victim which it paralyzes and carries back to the chamber. Once in the chamber, the hornet uses its mud-like compound to bind its prey and injects it with 2-4 (2d8) eggs. It leaves promptly thereafter, pausing only to seal the egg chamber (which takes 1-6 hours), Mere hours later, the eggs hatch and the larvae within begin to feed on the body around them. The six inch long larvae do 1 point of damage each per turn. After devouring the body, the young hornets break through the wall of the egg chamber by dissolving it with their saliva and fly off to begin their lives in the wild.</p>
					<p>Although hornets do not keep treasure troves, their egg chambers may be a source of valuable in the form of victims' possessions.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>The giant hornets are the result of deliberate tampering with nature. They roam the world mindlessly following their primal instinct to reproduce.</p>
					<p>Hornet toxin decays quickly when removed from the body. It can be used to coat blades and such only if the toxin is less than two days old. The toxin may also be used in the preparation of anti-paralysis potions and antidotes.</p>
					<p><b>Gianl Wasp</b></p>
					<p>These insects are very similar to giant hornets but live in swarms of as many as 20 individuals. Giant wasps are cooperative insects who build and maintain immense hives. Constructed of a thick paper-like substance, giant wasp hives are home to 21-40 (1d20+20) adults and 100-400 (1d4x100) eggs, larvae, and pupae. Their hives may surround a lace tree or fill a vast chamber in the earth.</p>
					<p>A giant wasp first attacks with its powerful bite ( <b>2d4 points of damage </b>), then stabs with its stinger (1-4 points). Failure to make a save against poison means that any victim hit by the stinger has been injured with a poison similar to that employs by the giant hornet. Paralyzed victims are carried back to the hive and placed in the communal egg chamber where they are quickly consumed by the hungry young.</p>

					<p>Horses are large quadrupeds often used for transportation, or as pack and draft animals, by human and demihuman races. They are frequently bred for their speed and for their beauty.</p>
					<p>A horse can be solid white, gray, chestnut, brown, black, or various reddish tones; its hide can instead show a variation or combination of these colors. Some of the more interesting variations include the piebald, which has a coat of large, irregular patches of black and white; the palomino, with its rich yellow-gold coat and white mane and tail; and the dapple gray, which is dark gray with flecks of lighter color on the chest, belly, and hindquarters.</p>
					<p>In addition to the coat's color, the horse may have markings of various sorts. The long hairs of the mane and tail can be lighter, darker, or of the same color as the body of the horse. Possible markings include socks (meaning the leg from the hoof, halfway to the knee, or hock, is white); a white muzzle; a blaze (a wide band of white from the top of the horse's head to the tip of its nose); and a star (a white, diamond-shaped patch set on the horse's forehead, right between its eyes).</p>
					<p>Horses are measured in 'hands'. One hand equals 4 inches.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>War horses will fight independently of the rider on the second and succeeding rounds of a melee. Other breeds fight only if cornered. Most attack twice per round by kicking with their front hooves.</p>
					<p>Unless specially trained, horses can be panicked by loud noises, strange smells, fire, or sudden movements 90% of the time. Horses trained and accustomed to such things (usually warhorses) panic only 10% of the time.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>The horse's gestation period is about 11 months. Mares (female horses) usually give birth to a single foal (young horse). Twins do occur, but only about 10% of the time (or less). Even triplets are possible, but are extremely rare. The foal is weaned after six months. It is mature after two to three years, and is considered adult at age five. The usual life span of a horse is 30-35 years, though rare exceptions have lived to age 50, and hard-worked horses rarely live past age 12.</p>
					<p>Only 10% of ponies and wild horses can be trained to serve as warhorses. Of all the breeds and varieties listed here, only mules are agile enough for use in mountainous or subterranean environments.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Modern horses evolved in temperate plains and grasslands. Domestic breeds can be found anywhere people live (even in the high mountains, if the local roads are good).</p>
					<p>Horses can carry great weights for long periods of time, but not without tiring. The table below shows the maximum weight a horse can carry; as illustrated, greater weights cause the horse to move at slower movement rates. Horse Table 1. Maximum weight in pounds at</p>

					<p>As noted in Chapter 14 of the <i>Player's Handbook </i>, in a day of travel over good terrain, a creature can travel a number of miles equal to twice its normal movement rate. A horse's overland movement rate can be improved by pushing it to a canter or gallop. A canter can be safely maintained for two hours, or a gallop for one hour, but the horse must be walked for an hour before its speed can again be increased. For the effects of increasing a horse's speed enough to affect its overland movement rate, see Chapter 14 of the <i>DMG </i>.</p>
					<p>A horse will not gallop when loaded with enough material to reduce its normal movement rate by half; nor will it canter or gallop if carrying a load which will reduce its normal movement rate to one-third normal (see Horse Table 1).</p>
					<p><b>Draft Horse</b></p>
					<p>Draft horses are large animals bred to haul very heavy loads, and are usually trained to be part of a dray team. Muscular but slow, these ponderous animals haul freight over long distances without complaint, and are frequently used by traders.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>War Horse</b></p>
					<p>Warhorses are bred and trained to the lance, the spear, and the sword. They have higher morale than other horses, and are not as skittish about sudden movements and loud noises. The choice of knights and cavalry, these are the pinnacle of military horses. There are three varieties; heavy, medium and light.</p>
					<p><i>Heavy war horses </i>are similar to draft animals. Large and muscular, they are relatively slow. Their size and powerful legs allow them to be armored in plate, and to carry a warrior in plate, as easily as a pony carries saddle bags. A good heavy war horse, fully trained, costs 400 or more gold pieces.</p>
					<p><i>Medium war horses </i>are lighter and smaller than their heavy cousins. They can be encumbered with leather or light plate armor and carry a rider wearing leather or light plate. The advantage of the medium war horse is its increased speed. The price of a medium war horse is 200 gp or more.</p>
					<p><i>Light war horses </i>are the fastest of the breed. They can carry warriors in leather armor, but are rarely armored themselves. They make excellent mounts for raiding parties, light cavalry, and thieves. Light war horses cost 150 gp or more.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Pony</b></p>
					<p>Small horses used primarily for transportation and occasionally farm work, ponies are a lively breed. They are more excitable than the larger horses, but frequently more gentle, as well. They are sometimes trained and used as war horses by several of the smaller demihuman races. Prices vary depending on training and size, but most cost around 500 gp.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Wild Horse</b></p>
					<p>Wild horses can be captured and trained to serve as mounts or work ponies. Training usually takes twice as long as training a domestic horse. Wild horses are hardy but jittery, and difficult to catch in the wild. They are sometimes hunted for food by human and demihuman tribes.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Riding Horse</b></p>
					<p>Riding horses are bred to the saddle. Perhaps the most common of all horses, they are ridden, worked, and raced by humans and demihumans alike. The price of a riding horse will vary, depending on its bloodlines, training, and appearance. Fast and agile, this breed is a good choice for personal transportation and general use.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Mule</b></p>
					<p>Sterile hybrids of horses and donkeys, mules are very sure-footed and exceptionally stubborn. They can be ridden by patient handlers who know how to control them, but are best used as pack animals in difficult or mountainous terrain. They are sometimes used by adventurers, for they are the only breed that can be taken into subterranean regions. The price of mules depends on how much grief they have given their current owners.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Steppe Pony</b></p>
					<p>A steppe pony is not attractive, graceful, or large, but its homely, ungainly appearance disguises an animal of great endurance, speed, and strength. A steppe pony looks like a cross between a horse and a pony, but is a breed unto itself. They are small, averaging 13 hands (4'4') at the withers, and they have short necks, large heads, and heavily boned bodies. Their winter coat is shaggy and gives them the appearance of being 'half-wild'. They are most commonly colored copper or bronze, with a light yellow stripe running down their backs.</p>
					<p>These horses are tough, hard to kill, and aggressive in battle. They have most of the same characteristics as a light war horse, with a few exceptions. It attacks three times per round, its third attack being a bite which causes <b>1-3 points of damage </b>. The steppe pony's thick, shaggy coat and tough hide gives it an AC of 6. Its short legs are powerful and can carry horse and rider swiftly, over long distances; its small back is also very strong and it can carry as much as a medium war horse (220/330/440). The steppe pony is even-tempered and steady in battle; its morale is average (8-10), and it panics very rarely (5% chance) due to such things as fire and loud noises.</p>
					<p>The steppe pony has remarkable endurance. It can survive by grazing alone and does not require feeding and handling by its rider, so separate supplies of grain are not needed. It can be ridden for long distances without tiring or faltering. A +3 modifier is applied to the pony's saving throws for lameness and exhaustion checks when travelling overland.</p>
					<p>In spite of all its qualities, the steppe pony is not sought after or considered valuable. It is most commonly ridden by nomadic tribes. Outside the steppes, the animal is almost completely unknown and does not command high prices at auction. Only breeders who know the steppe pony's qualities, and who seek strength and stamina in their own horses' bloodlines, are likely to consider the steppe pony as valuable.</p>

A canter can be safely maintained for two hours, or a gallop for one hour, but the horse must be walked for an hour before its speed can again be increased. For the effects of increasing a horse's speed enough to affect its overland movement rate, see Chapter 14 of the <i>DMG </i>.</p>
					<p>A horse will not gallop when loaded with enough material to reduce its normal movement rate by half; nor will it canter or gallop if carrying a load which will reduce its normal movement rate to one-third normal (see Horse Table 1).</p>
					<p><b>Draft Horse</b></p>
					<p>Draft horses are large animals bred to haul very heavy loads, and are usually trained to be part of a dray team. Muscular but slow, these ponderous animals haul freight over long distances without complaint, and are frequently used by traders.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>War Horse</b></p>
					<p>Warhorses are bred and trained to the lance, the spear, and the sword. They have higher morale than other horses, and are not as skittish about sudden movements and loud noises. The choice of knights and cavalry, these are the pinnacle of military horses. There are three varieties; heavy, medium and light.</p>
					<p><i>Heavy war horses </i>are similar to draft animals. Large and muscular, they are relatively slow. Their size and powerful legs allow them to be armored in plate, and to carry a warrior in plate, as easily as a pony carries saddle bags. A good heavy war horse, fully trained, costs 400 or more gold pieces.</p>
					<p><i>Medium war horses </i>are lighter and smaller than their heavy cousins. They can be encumbered with leather or light plate armor and carry a rider wearing leather or light plate. The advantage of the medium war horse is its increased speed. The price of a medium war horse is 200 gp or more.</p>
					<p><i>Light war horses </i>are the fastest of the breed. They can carry warriors in leather armor, but are rarely armored themselves. They make excellent mounts for raiding parties, light cavalry, and thieves. Light war horses cost 150 gp or more.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Pony</b></p>
					<p>Small horses used primarily for transportation and occasionally farm work, ponies are a lively breed. They are more excitable than the larger horses, but frequently more gentle, as well. They are sometimes trained and used as war horses by several of the smaller demihuman races. Prices vary depending on training and size, but most cost around 500 gp.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Wild Horse</b></p>
					<p>Wild horses can be captured and trained to serve as mounts or work ponies. Training usually takes twice as long as training a domestic horse. Wild horses are hardy but jittery, and difficult to catch in the wild. They are sometimes hunted for food by human and demihuman tribes.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Riding Horse</b></p>
					<p>Riding horses are bred to the saddle. Perhaps the most common of all horses, they are ridden, worked, and raced by humans and demihumans alike. The price of a riding horse will vary, depending on its bloodlines, training, and appearance. Fast and agile, this breed is a good choice for personal transportation and general use.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Mule</b></p>
					<p>Sterile hybrids of horses and donkeys, mules are very sure-footed and exceptionally stubborn. They can be ridden by patient handlers who know how to control them, but are best used as pack animals in difficult or mountainous terrain. They are sometimes used by adventurers, for they are the only breed that can be taken into subterranean regions. The price of mules depends on how much grief they have given their current owners.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Steppe Pony</b></p>
					<p>A steppe pony is not attractive, graceful, or large, but its homely, ungainly appearance disguises an animal of great endurance, speed, and strength. A steppe pony looks like a cross between a horse and a pony, but is a breed unto itself. They are small, averaging 13 hands (4'4') at the withers, and they have short necks, large heads, and heavily boned bodies. Their winter coat is shaggy and gives them the appearance of being 'half-wild'. They are most commonly colored copper or bronze, with a light yellow stripe running down their backs.</p>
					<p>These horses are tough, hard to kill, and aggressive in battle. They have most of the same characteristics as a light war horse, with a few exceptions. It attacks three times per round, its third attack being a bite which causes <b>1-3 points of damage </b>. The steppe pony's thick, shaggy coat and tough hide gives it an AC of 6. Its short legs are powerful and can carry horse and rider swiftly, over long distances; its small back is also very strong and it can carry as much as a medium war horse (220/330/440). The steppe pony is even-tempered and steady in battle; its morale is average (8-10), and it panics very rarely (5% chance) due to such things as fire and loud noises.</p>
					<p>The steppe pony has remarkable endurance. It can survive by grazing alone and does not require feeding and handling by its rider, so separate supplies of grain are not needed. It can be ridden for long distances without tiring or faltering. A +3 modifier is applied to the pony's saving throws for lameness and exhaustion checks when travelling overland.</p>
					<p>In spite of all its qualities, the steppe pony is not sought after or considered valuable. It is most commonly ridden by nomadic tribes. Outside the steppes, the animal is almost completely unknown and does not command high prices at auction. Only breeders who know the steppe pony's qualities, and who seek strength and stamina in their own horses' bloodlines, are likely to consider the steppe pony as valuable.</p>

					<p>Horses are large quadrupeds often used for transportation, or as pack and draft animals, by human and demihuman races. They are frequently bred for their speed and for their beauty.</p>
					<p>A horse can be solid white, gray, chestnut, brown, black, or various reddish tones; its hide can instead show a variation or combination of these colors. Some of the more interesting variations include the piebald, which has a coat of large, irregular patches of black and white; the palomino, with its rich yellow-gold coat and white mane and tail; and the dapple gray, which is dark gray with flecks of lighter color on the chest, belly, and hindquarters.</p>
					<p>In addition to the coat's color, the horse may have markings of various sorts. The long hairs of the mane and tail can be lighter, darker, or of the same color as the body of the horse. Possible markings include socks (meaning the leg from the hoof, halfway to the knee, or hock, is white); a white muzzle; a blaze (a wide band of white from the top of the horse's head to the tip of its nose); and a star (a white, diamond-shaped patch set on the horse's forehead, right between its eyes).</p>
					<p>Horses are measured in 'hands'. One hand equals 4 inches.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>War horses will fight independently of the rider on the second and succeeding rounds of a melee. Other breeds fight only if cornered. Most attack twice per round by kicking with their front hooves.</p>
					<p>Unless specially trained, horses can be panicked by loud noises, strange smells, fire, or sudden movements 90% of the time. Horses trained and accustomed to such things (usually warhorses) panic only 10% of the time.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>The horse's gestation period is about 11 months. Mares (female horses) usually give birth to a single foal (young horse). Twins do occur, but only about 10% of the time (or less). Even triplets are possible, but are extremely rare. The foal is weaned after six months. It is mature after two to three years, and is considered adult at age five. The usual life span of a horse is 30-35 years, though rare exceptions have lived to age 50, and hard-worked horses rarely live past age 12.</p>
					<p>Only 10% of ponies and wild horses can be trained to serve as warhorses. Of all the breeds and varieties listed here, only mules are agile enough for use in mountainous or subterranean environments.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Modern horses evolved in temperate plains and grasslands. Domestic breeds can be found anywhere people live (even in the high mountains, if the local roads are good).</p>
					<p>Horses can carry great weights for long periods of time, but not without tiring. The table below shows the maximum weight a horse can carry; as illustrated, greater weights cause the horse to move at slower movement rates. Horse Table 1. Maximum weight in pounds at</p>

					<p>These fearsome flying hounds, magical creatures of the night, hunt humans, demihumans, and faerie folk.</p>
					<p>The yeth hound pack, with its baying bell-like cries, causes fear to any being. Even those who stand their ground know fear, and that fear returns to them in the night or in dark places. Indeed, some metaphysicians have theorized that the hounds embody fear itself. The warrrior-poet Rodol of Ard wrote of the yeth hounds:</p>
					<p><i>The baying sound echoes through my blood.I have heard the call of the Hound.As in a nightmare, I run from that sound!My bravery vanishes in fear's flood.Whence come the hounds? In what cave do they lair?Why have they chosen me, I who was brave?What will become of me now, as fear's slave?Will I live until morning to breathe light air?They will never leave, for they lodge in my dreams.I know they'll devour me, leaving only my screams.</i></p>
					<p>Indeed, the encounter with a pack of yeth hounds apparently provoked Rodol's retirement from adventuring. He secluded himself on his estate, banned dogs and wolves from his lands, and devoted himself to poetry (without, however, improving much). Rodol lived many years after writing this poem, but he never left his castle. He reported terrible dreams almost every night. One evening he heard a pack of coyotes howling in the distance, and he died of a heart attack.</p>
					<p>Standing five feet at the shoulder, yeth hounds weigh around 400 pounds. Their short fur is dull, nonreflective black; in darkness only the cherry-red glow of their eyes is visible. Their heads are almost human, flat with protruding noses instead of muzzles. Their short pointed ears curve up and away from the head, making them look like short horns. They give off an odor like chilled smoke.</p>
					<p>Because they can fly, yeth hounds move silently. However, their ghastly howl chills the blood up to a mile away. These unnatural creatures frequently run with evil huntsmen or other powerful evil forces.</p>
					<p><b><u></u></b></p>
					<p></p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p><b><u>Those within 90' of a baying pack of yeth hounds must save vs. spells or flee in panic, usually to be pulled down and shredded by the ferocious pack </u></b>. Only one saving throw per creature per encounter is allowed. If it fails, the character panics until he can no longer hear the baying. If it succeeds, he withstands the baying for the rest of that encounter.</p>
					<p>The yeth hound is <b><u>immune to all physical weapons except silver or magical ones </u></b>. Silver weapons inflict 1 hp damage. Magical weapons cause damage equal to their bonus; for example, a sword +2 inflicts 2 hp damage. Magical weapons with no bonus cause 1 hp damage.</p>
					<p>Although yeth hounds are smarter than dogs, their tactics in combat resemble those of pack hunters. They run their prey until it is exhausted, then surround the victim and rush in to finish it off. They have no claw attack, only a bite ( <b>2d4 damage </b>). If under the control of a huntsman, he can direct their strategy or tactics.</p>
					<p>Unnatural creatures of the night, yeth hounds are unaffected by torchlight or <i>light </i>spells but cannot stand daylight. Before sunrise they leave the hunt, always in enough time for a safe retreat to their dens. No coercion by any huntsman can change this. If exposed to natural sunlight, the hounds fade away in one round, to roam the Ethereal Plane forever. If killed on the Ethereal, they are permanently dead.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Yeth hounds are created by evil forces from the Lower Planes and given to loyal servants. If the servants are destroyed, the hounds fend for themselves. These pack animals intelligently seek powerful evil masters: night hags, vampires, evil wizards, etc. Of course such a master must be <b><u>immune to the fearful baying of the creatures and have some way to command them (usually telepathy) </u></b>. Magic lets them comprehend speech by spells, but they cannot talk.</p>
					<p>Within a pack, the hound with the most hit points leads the rest. They give the leader instant cooperation and obedience. They do not help one another, and they are not swayed by threats or promises of great reward. They take pleasure only in the panicked cries of their prey, just before it is pulled down.</p>
					<p>The pack lairs in a subterranean den in some remote wild place, sleeping or pacing, until night falls. No persuasion forces them into daylight.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Yeth hounds eat to survive, but only once each lunar month. They devour warm-blooded prey, and prefer demihumans, brownies, and the like. No natural animal hunts a yeth hound, and many unnatural creatures avoid them as well.</p>

					<p>Howlers are the keening brood-hounds or Pandemonium, the singers of dementia who cluster around the great rocky spires in those plunging caves. In that eternally night-lit plane the howlers are drawn to shriek their madness to the moonless heavens</p>
					<p>The howlers are gigantic beasts, four-legged, with the burly backs of oxen and scales glinting through their matted red fur. This fur spreads into a thick ruff of trembling quills that frame their simian faces. Their front claws are the clotted knots of coarse fingers too long crnshed under the beastly weight, their back feet are hooved. When they cry, they rock back until they almost stand and throw their muzzled faces toward the missing sky. Lips pursed into a perfect O, they howl the voices of madness.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Although brutish and cruel, howlers aren't particularly aggressive beasts. Scavengers by nature, they seldom attack groups larger than their own numbers or any that seem more capable of defending themselves. When a howler pack does attack, it usually singles out a weak victim, while trying to hold the rest at bay. If this proves impossible, the howler pack breaks and flees.</p>
					<p>This doesn't mean, however, that howlers are weak opponents. Far from it - their own cowardice makes them formidable opponents. When a howler pack does attack, it is determined and ruthless. All energy is devoted to bringing down the prey.</p>
					<p>In actual battle, howlers can choose from several attack forms. Normally they rush in on the first round of combat, attempting to get within biting distance as soon as possible. The rush and the round that follows are the two most dangerous moments or any howler attack. As they rush forward, their neck bristles rise to form a spined shield, reducing their Armor Class to 3. If the howlers move 120 reel or more in the charge, they gain a +2 bonus to their chance to hit and their damage is doubled for carrying the charge through. Finally, while in their frenzied charge, the howlers are <b><u>immune to all morale checks </u></b>.</p>
					<p>Once in combat, howlers fight by snapping their powerful jaws and savagely slashing with their erect neck quills. The quills can only be used on those at the creatures' forward flanks and aren't particularly accurate (-2 on the chance to hit). Each successful hit jabs the person with 1d4 quills, and each quill causes <b>1d4 points of damage </b>. <b><u>Creatures struck by the quills must make a saving throw versus breath weapon for each quill </u></b>. For each save that is failed, the quill remains embedded In the victim. The victim's attack rolls are reduced by 1. Removing quills takes 1d6 rounds and causes an additional <b>1d3 points of damage </b>.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Howlers are beasts native to the tunnels of Pandemonium and are not naturally found on any other plane. Even within Pandemonium they aren't found everywhere. They stay far from the settled regions and the small tunnels, preferring the larger curved passages that pass for plains and grassland. On these plains they hunt in packs; for they are carnivorous scavengers.</p>
					<p>There is no hard and fast size for a howler pack, as is the way of the animal kingdom. Packs range from 2 to as many as 20 members. This number includes bulls, females, and kits. (Of a pack, it is the bulls who defend the others, hence the small number met in a normal encounter) The packs scour the land. searching for anything edible. As news of their migrations travels through the tunnels, other dwellers in Pandemonium brace themselves for the agony that is sure to come.</p>
					<p>Howlers are aptly named, for their howls cut through the whistling wind with the pitch of madness. Their cries have the same effects as the winds of Pandemonium, gradually driving those who hear them to insanity. Whenever a howler lets loose its cry, all within hearing distance, whether indoor or out, must make a check as if they were exposed to Pandemonium's winds. A howler's cry lacks the full strength of the winds - their keening pitch can never push a chancier beyond Stage 3 (Hysteria). Characters who have already reached Resignation exhibit all their tics and twitches when the howlers sing. Even on other planes, a howler's effect travels with it.</p>
					<p>It is fortunate that howlers don't bay all the time. In that regard they are more like common dogs. They howl and keen occasionally, when the circumstances are right. As pack animals, they howl when they are lonely - kept in the stable apart from their masters, for example. They howl during the rutting season and when their territory is challenged. They howl when cornered. The DM has final say over when the beasts bay to the blackness.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Howlers would be just another bane of Pandemonium were it not for those in the tunnels who can capture and tame the beasts to be good riding and pack mounts. A howler has the carrying capacity of a draft horse, and is far better adapted to traveling the twisted tunnels than a simple horse.</p>
					<p>Some wizards claim the howlers sing secrets of the planes, a code concealed in their pitch and their keening. Others think the wizards have been howled mad by their studies.</p>

					<p>Hydrae are immense reptilian monsters with multiple heads. For each Hit Die the hydra has, it will have one head. The chart above lists the THAC0 value for hydrae, the number of heads and the damage that they inflict each time they bite.</p>
					<p>Hydrae are gray-brown to dark brown, with light yellow or tan underbellies. Their eyes are amber and their teeth are yellow-white. Hydrae have between 5 and 12 heads (1d8 +4).</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Hydrae always have 8 points on each of their Hit Dice and all heads must be severed before the hydra dies. A hydra can bring up to four heads into action against a single foe, biting once with each of them.</p>
					<p>Each time a hydra takes 8 points of damage, one of its heads is assumed to have been severed. When this happens, a natural reflex seals the neck arteries shut to prevent blood loss.</p>
					<p>Hydrae attack according to the number of heads they have. Therefore, a 10-headed hydra continues to attack as a 10 HD monster even after several heads have been slain.</p>
					<p>Attacks on the body have no effect unless a single attack inflicts damage equal to the hydra's original hit points.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Hydrae are solitary creatures who prefer dismal surroundings. They gather only to mate.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Despite the hydra's size and multiple attacks, they are often preyed upon by dragons. They are impossible to train.</p>
					<p><b>Lernaean Hydra</b></p>
					<p>Although similar to a normal hydra, Lernaean hydrae will regenerate two heads for each one that is severed. A maximum of 12 heads can be grown. New heads form in 1-4 rounds and can be avoided only by the prompt application of flame to the neck following the attack which destroyed the first head. This hydra's body is <b><u>immune to all attacks </u></b>.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Pyrohydra</b></p>

					<p>Hydrae are immense reptilian monsters with multiple heads. For each Hit Die the hydra has, it will have one head. The chart above lists the THAC0 value for hydrae, the number of heads and the damage that they inflict each time they bite.</p>
					<p>Hydrae are gray-brown to dark brown, with light yellow or tan underbellies. Their eyes are amber and their teeth are yellow-white. Hydrae have between 5 and 12 heads (1d8 +4).</p>

					<p>Each time a hydra takes 8 points of damage, one of its heads is assumed to have been severed. When this happens, a natural reflex seals the neck arteries shut to prevent blood loss.</p>
					<p>Hydrae attack according to the number of heads they have. Therefore, a 10-headed hydra continues to attack as a 10 HD monster even after several heads have been slain.</p>
					<p>Attacks on the body have no effect unless a single attack inflicts damage equal to the hydra's original hit points.</p>

					<p>Hyenae are canines who roam warm grasslands and plains. They are primarily scavengers, but will hunt small game on occasion. Their powerful jaws give them a nasty bite.</p>
					<p>Hyenae are ugly animals. Roughly the size of a large dog, the hyena's body is covered with a light brown or golden fur. Its feet, markings, and belly are black. The hyena's shorter rear legs make it look clumsy - an illusion which is quickly dispelled when it attacks.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Hyenae are cowards. They do not attack unless their prey is helpless, outnumbered, or dead already.</p>
					<p>Hyenae surround a victim and rush in at it from all sides, attacking with a strong bite that does 2-8 (2d4) points of damage. A natural attack roll of 20 indicates that the hyena has locked its jaws onto the victim. Once this happens, the animal will not let go until it suffers 2 or more points of damage. Such holding bites do not do additional damage but can slow the victim down because of the hyena's extra weight. Each hyena reduces a victim's movement rate by 6. The number of hyenae which can lock onto a victim is determined by its size. One hyena can lock onto a tiny animal, two to a small one, and so forth.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Hyenae roam the open plains of warm, grassy regions. They are usually found within sight of a herd of animals like zebra and antelope. Generally, there will be 1 hyena for every 10 herd animals being followed. A typical hyena pack can survive on one man-sized animal every three days. If they attack and kill an animal, they will strip it to the bones in short order. Any carrion which they encounter will also be consumed.</p>
					<p>Hyenae are instinctively aware of their place in the animal hierarchy. They defer to larger or more powerful predators like lions. If such an animal makes a kill they will sit 50' to 100' away and patiently wait for the predator to finish and leave. If given the chance, they have been known to try to snatch portions of the carcass and run. They may openly challenge other, less powerful or numerous, predators.</p>
					<p>Hyenae travel in packs composed of an even mixture of adult males, females, and young. Although they do not mate for life, a hyena couple will remain together for several years. The male assists in caring for the 2-4 cubs which are born in each litter. The young do not nurse, but are fed regurgitated food in a manner similar to that employed by many avian species.</p>
					<p>During their first year of life cubs will not attack. They are one Hit Die animals who run for the protection of their parents and the pack if threatened. During the second year, the cubs gain an additional Hit Die and begin to hunt alongside the adults. Hyenae become fully mature in three years.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Hyenae are active scavengers who feed on the carrion left behind by other, larger predators. They are also able to take living prey, although they normally restrict their hunting to small, young, old, or sick animals. They have strong constitutions and digestive tracts that enable them to safely digest even diseased meat.</p>
					<p>Hyenae produce few useful byproducts. The skins make poor leather, the fur tends to fall out, and the meat has a decidedly rancid taste. Cubs are difficult to domesticate as they usually revert to the wild upon hitting maturity. However. they may be found as companions of nomadic, aboriginal people.</p>
					<p><b>Hyaenodon</b></p>
					<p>Although the hyaenodon resembles a giant hyena it is actually not related at all. It is a survivor of prehistoric times, a predator that evolved into a canine-like form. Hyaenodon markings are similar to those of hyenae, although the dominant fur color is a lion-like gold. Despite their genetic differences, they are very similar to hyenae in temperament and behavior. Hyaenodon females give birth to litters of 1-4 cubs. These mature within 4 years.</p>
					<p>Its savage bite does 3-12 (3d4) points of damage and it can lock onto its victims just as smaller hyenae do. If the hyaenodon does this, the victim's movement rate is cut by 12 for each hyaenodon that attaches itself. Hyaenodon packs will devour one man-sized victim per day. Because of their larger size, they are able to take large prey such as elephants, oxen. and buffalo. If a giant hyena suffers 2 or more points of burning damage. it immediately flees the area in search of a spot to tend its wounds.</p>

					<p>Imps are diminutive creatures of an evil nature who roam the world and act as familiars for lawful evil wizards and priests.</p>
					<p>The average imp is a 2' humanoid with leathery, bat-like wings, a barbed tail, and sharp, twisted horns. Its skin is a dark red and its horns and jagged teeth are a gleaming white.</p>
					<p>The imp can <i>polymorph </i>itself into two other animal forms. The most commonly encountered alternate forms are those of a large spider, raven, giant rat, or goat. In such forms the imp is physically identical to a normal animal.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>In its natural form, the imp attacks with the wicked stinger on its tail. <b><u>In addition to inflicting 1-4 points of damage </u></b><u>, this stinger injects a powerful poison which is so deadly that those who fail their save versus poison are instantly slain by it </u>. When it is polymorphed, the imp attacks with the natural weaponry of its adopted form, though the goat and raven forms lack damaging attacks.</p>
					<p>The imp can use its special magical abilities no matter what its form. All imps are able to <i>detect good </i>, <i>detect magic </i>, or become <i>invisible </i>at will. Once per day they can use a <i>suggestion </i>.</p>
					<p>Imps are <b><u>immune to attacks based on cold, fire, or electricity and resist all other spell attacks as if they were 7 Hit Die creatures </u></b>. They can be harmed only by silver or magical weapons and are able to regenerate one hit point per melee round.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Imps are beings of a very evil nature who originate on the darkest of evil planes. Their main purpose on the Prime Material plane is to spread evil by assisting lawful evil wizards and priests. When such a person is judged worthy of an imp's service, the imp comes in answer to a <i>find familiar </i>spell.</p>
					<p>Once they have contacted their new 'master\xA8, imps begin at once to take control of his actions. Although imps maintain the illusion that the summoner is in charge, the actual relationship is closer to that of a workman (the imp) and his tools (the master).</p>
					<p>Although an imp's body can be destroyed on the Prime Material plane, it is not so easily slain. When its physical form is lost, its corrupt spirit instantly returns to its home plane where it is reformed and, after a time, returned to our world to resume its work.</p>
					<p>While they are technically in the service of their master, imps retain a basic independence and ambition to become more powerful someday. They may acquire treasure from those they slay, and will often pilfer valuables encountered during their travels.</p>
					<p>The imp confers some of its powers upon its master. A telepathic link connects the two whenever they are within one mile of each other. This enables the master to receive all of the imp's sensory impressions, including its infravision. The master also gains the imp's inherent 25% magical resistance and is able to regenerate just as the imp does. If the imp is within telepathic range, the master acts as if he were one level higher than he actually is. Conversely, if the imp is more than a mile away, the master acts as if he were one level of ability below his actual rank. If the imp is killed, the master instantly drops by four levels, though these can be regained in the usual manner.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Imps are the errand boys of the powerful evil beings who command the darkest planes. They often act as emissaries and agents, but their primary task is to enhance the spread of evil in our world.</p>
					<p><b>Quasit</b></p>
					<p>Quasits are chaotic evil counterparts to imps. The chaotic evil priests and wizards which quasits 'serve' gain the same benefits and disadvantages that an imp's master does. Like imps, each quasit can assume two other forms. Those most commonly chosen by quasits are bats, giant centipedes, frogs, or wolves. They can use their magic in any of their forms.</p>
					<p>The quasit attacks with its clawed hands (doing 1-2 points each) and its deadly bite (doing 1-4 points). <b><u>The quasit's claws are coated in a toxin which causes anyone struck by them to save versus poison or lose one point of dexterity for 2-12 (2d6) rounds </u></b>. The effects of multiple wounds are cumulative.</p>
					<p>Quasits can turn <i>invisible </i>, <i>detect good </i>, or <i>detect magic </i>at will. They regenerate 1 hit point per round and can unleash a blast of fear with a 30 foot range radius once per day. Once each week the quasit can commune with the lower planes (asking up to 6 questions).</p>
					<p>Quasits can only be harmed by cold iron or magical weapons. They are able to resist magic 25% of the time, save as if they were 7 Hit Die monsters and are <b><u>immune to cold, fire, and lightning </u></b>.</p>

					<p>The invisible stalker is a creature from the elemental plane of Air. Those encountered on the Prime Material plane have almost always been summoned by wizards to fulfill a specific task.</p>
					<p>The true form of the invisible stalker is unknown. On the Material, Astral, or Ethereal planes, the invisible stalker can only be perceived as a shimmering air mass which looks much like the refraction effect caused by hot air passing in front of cold.</p>
					<p>Invisible stalkers understand the common speech of men, but can not speak it. They can converse only in their own language, which sounds much like the roaring and whooshing of a great wind storm.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Invisible stalkers attack by using the air itself as a weapon. It is capable of creating a sudden, intense vortex that batters a victim for 4-16 (4d4) points of damage. Such attacks affect a single victim on the same plane as the invisible stalker.</p>
					<p>Due to their invisibility, these creatures impose a -6 penalty on the surprise rolls of those they choose to attack. Similarly, all opponents who are unable to see or detect invisible foes are at a -2 on their attack rolls. Although they are fully invisible on the Prime Material plane, their outlines can be dimly perceived on the Astral or Ethereal planes.</p>
					<p>Invisible stalkers can only be killed on the elemental plane of Air. If attacked on another plane, they automatically return to their home plane when their total hit points are exceeded by the damage they suffered.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Little is known about the lives of these creatures on their home plane. It is assumed that they are similar to normal air elementals when encountered there.</p>
					<p>Those present on the material plane are there as the result of a conjuration by some wizard. This magic causes the creature to serve its summoner for a time. The conjurer retains full command of the stalker until it either fulfills its duties or is defeated and driven back to its home plane. Once given a task, an invisible stalker is relentless. They are faultless trackers who can detect any trail less than a day old. If ordered to attack, they will do so with great fury and will cease their efforts only upon their own destruction or the direct orders of their master. Once their mission is accomplished, the creature is free to return to its home plane.</p>
					<p>The invisible stalker is, at best, an unwilling servant. It resents any task assigned to it, although brief, uncomplicated labors may be seen as something of a diversion and thus undertaken with little resentment. Tasks that require a week or more of its time will drive the invisible stalker to pervert the stated intent of the command. Such commands must be carefully worded and come from a powerful wizard. An invisible stalker may look for a loop hole in the command as a means of striking back at its master. For example, a simple command such as 'keep me safe from all harm' may result in the stalker carrying the conjurer back to the elemental plane of air and leaving him there in a well hidden location. Each day of the invisible stalker's indenturedness there is a 1% cumulative chance that the creature will seek a means to pervert its commands and free itself of servitude. If no option is open, the creature must continue to serve.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Invisible stalkers are a species unwillingly transplanted to the Prime Material plane. They are slaves whose terms of servitude dominate their brief stays. Those who have been subjected to great hardship, assigned very difficult tasks, or who have faced death at the hands of humanoids, tend to retain a distrust or outright hatred of them. Those that have had an easy time during past periods of service or who are first time arrivals on the Prime Material plane may be easier to deal with. Such feelings may carry over to influence encounters with humanoids traveling in the aerial plane. Anyone who has befriended an invisible stalker in the past will find that voyages through the plane of elemental Air are far less hazardous than they might otherwise have been.</p>
					<p>Invisible stalkers only obey those who actually summon them and few wizards can be commissioned to summon such a being on another's behalf. Some mercenary wizards have been able to construct the necessary summons onto scrolls that are usable by others. These sell for between 5,000 and 10,000 gp and are very dangerous to use. Even the slightest error can cause users of such scrolls to come to a tragic end.</p>

					<p>Kobolds are a cowardly, sadistic race of short humanoids that vigorously contest the human and demi-human races for living space and food. They especially dislike gnomes and attack them on sight.</p>
					<p>Barely clearing 3 feet in height, kobolds have scaly hides that range from dark, rusty brown to a rusty black. They smell of damp dogs and stagnant water. Their eyes glow like a bright red spark and they have two small horns ranging from tan to white. Because of the kobolds' fondness for wearing raggedy garb of red and orange, their non-prehensile rat-like tails, and their language (which sounds like small dogs yapping), these fell creatures are often not taken seriously. This is often a fatal mistake, for what they lack in size and strength they make up in ferocity and tenacity.</p>
					<p>Kobolds speak their own language; some (75%) speak orc and goblin.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>The kobold approach to combat uses overwhelming odds or trickery. Kobolds will attack gnomes on sight, but will think twice about attacking humans, elves, or dwarves unless the kobolds outnumber them by at least two to one. They often hurl javelins and spears, preferring not to close until they see that their enemies have been weakened.</p>
					<p>Kobolds attack in overwhelming waves. Should the kobolds be reduced to only a three to two ratio in their favor, they must make a morale check. Kobolds are wary of spellcasters and will aim for them when possible.</p>
					<p>This diminutive race also enjoys setting up concealed pits with spikes, crossbows, and other mechanical traps. They usually have view ports and murder holes near these traps so that they can pour flaming oil, missile weapons, or drop poisonous insects on their victims.</p>
					<p>Kobold war bands are armed with spiked clubs, axes, javelins, short swords and spears. Their shields are seldom metal, but are normally wood or wicker. Chiefs and guards tend to have the best weapons available.</p>
					<p>Kobolds have 60-foot infravision but do not see well in bright sunlight, suffering a -1 on their attack rolls.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Kobolds live in dark, damp places underground and in overgrown forests. They can be found in almost any climate. As kobolds are good miners, any area with potential for mining is fair game for settlement.</p>
					<p>The average kobold tribe has 40-400 (4d10x10) adult males. For every 40 kobolds in a band there will be one leader and two bodyguards (AC 6; HD 1-1; hp 4 each; damage 1-6). In a lair there will be 5-20 (5d4) bodyguards, females equal to 50% of the males, young equal to 10% of the males and 30-300 (3d10x10) eggs. There will also be a chief and 2-8 guards (AC 5; HD 1+1; hp 7 each; damage 1-8). Further, there is a 65% chance there will be guard animals: (70%) 2-5 wild boars (AC 7; HD 3+3; damage 3d4 gore) or (30%) 1-4 giant weasels (AC 6; HD 3+3; damage 2d6 bite and blood drain). There may be one or more shamans.</p>
					<p>Their society is tribal but can be further broken up into war bands based on specific clans. As many as 10 families can be part of a clan, and each clan usually is responsible for controlling the area in a 10 mile radius from the lair. Kobolds recover treasure from the bodies of their victims and often carry them back to their lair as food. In some instances, kobolds will not kill their victims, but will sell them as slaves.</p>
					<p>Kobolds are distrustful of strangers. They hate brownies, pixies, sprites and gnomes. Gnomes are never eaten or taken prisoner.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Perhaps kobolds are so cruel because they are easy prey for larger humanoids and hungry monsters. They have many enemies, and even the dwarves have had to admit that the numerous kobold-goblin wars have kept the number of goblins down to a safe level.</p>
					<p>Kobolds can live 135 years.</p>

					<p>Urds are distant relatives of kobolds. Three feet tall, with short ivory horns, their bodies are frail and covered with mottled yellow to brick red scales. Their leathery, batlike wings span 8 feet.</p>
					<p>Urds have 60-foot infravision and prefer to hunt at night, dropping jagged stones (2-3 pounds each) from the air. Unsuspecting victims are AC 10 for the attack roll. Actively dodging opponents are considered AC 2 before modifications to Dexterity. Rocks cause <b>2d4 points of damage </b>. Some urds (25%) carry light sprears ( <b>1d4 damage </b>).</p>
					<p>A band of 20 urds is accompanied by a subchieftain (AC 7, 7 hp). Urd flocks of 100 or more include the chieftain (10 hp, 50% have magical leather armor). Urd lairs contain 1d6 shamans able to speak with bats as per <i>speak with animals </i>.</p>
					<p>Urd life spans can exceed 100 years, but they rarely live past 50.</p>

					<p>Of all the hazards that the desert presents, few can compare with the cruel race of flesh-eating creatures known as lamias. These half-human, half-quadruped beast hybrids use deceit, speed, and spells to entrap the foolhardy adventurer who dares wander into their ruins.</p>
					<p>Their upper torsos, arms, and heads resemble those of beautiful human women, while their lower bodies are those of beasts, such as goats, deer, or lions, with the appropriate coloration. This hybrid configuration makes lamias very fast and powerful. They are usually armed with daggers, which they use to carve up their prey for the feast. Lamias sometimes smell like perfume flowers, so as to attract unwary victims. They wear no clothing or jewelry. In communicating, they use the common tongue.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>A lamia is able to use the following spells once per day: <i>charm person </i>, <i>mirror image </i>, <i>suggestion </i>, and <i>illusion </i>(as a wand). For purposes of duration, effect, etc. assume that the lamia casts its spells at 9th-level spell ability. These spells are typically used to lure persons to the lamia and then hold them there for the creature to devour at its leisure.</p>
					<p>The lamia's touch permanently drains 1 point of Wisdom from a victim, and when his Wisdom drops below 3, he willingly does whatever the lamia tells him do. These orders often involve having the victim attack his compatriots while it continues whittling down their ranks. If it has a chance to drain the Wisdom of more than one victim, it will certainly do so. It may even use its <i>charm </i>spell to supplement its control over party members.</p>
					<p>Among a lamia's favorite illusions to cast upon itself are the following: a lovely damsel in distress, a tough but beautiful female ranger, or an elf maiden. At times, it simply may cast an illusion of a lost child in distress or a group of peasants being attacked by a large beast, while hiding itself, awaiting the right moment to attack from the rear.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Lamias dwell in ruined cities or caves, places situated in desert or wasteland areas. These evil creatures are solitary beasts, sustaining themselves on the flesh of those who walk too close to their territories. During lean times, they supplement their diet by stalking game animals. Lamias hardly ever venture more than 10 miles from their lairs.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Lamias are legendary monsters that prey upon travelers or guard hidden places or objects of power. They are mysterious creatures that seem devoted to the spreading of chaos and evil in their dwelling places.</p>
					<p><b>Lamia Noble</b></p>
					<p>These beings rule over the lamias and the wild, lonely areas they inhabit. They differ from the normal lamias in that the lamia nobles' lower bodies are those of giant serpents and their upper bodies can be either male or female. It is rumored that the normal female lamia is born from the union of two nobles.</p>
					<p>The males wield short swords and have 1d6 levels of wizard spells, plus the inherent spells <i>charm person </i>, <i>mirror image </i>, <i>suggestion </i>, and <i>illusion </i>. The females are unarmed and only attack with magic; they are more experienced magically and have 2d4 levels of wizard spells plus the usual inherent spells.</p>
					<p>Like normal lamia, lamia nobles have the Wisdom-draining touch.</p>
					<p>All lamia nobles are able to assume human form. In this guise they attempt to penetrate human society and wreak evil. They speak all of the languages of humans and demihumans. When in human form, they are recognizable as lamias by humans and demihumans only if the characters are of 7th level or higher, with a 5% cumulative chance per level above 6th. Priests and paladins receive an additional 15% chance (i.e., a 10th-level priest has a 35% chance). Lamia nobles are given to outbursts of senseless violence.</p>

					<p>Celestial lammasu are close relatives of the lammasu native to the Prime Material plane. These, however, make their homes among the wilderlands of Olympus. Celestial lammasu are sometimes also known as the 'lions of the Mount', referring to Mount Olympus, in whose shadow they so often are found.</p>
					<p>As might be expected, a celestial Lammasu has the body of a large, powerful lion. Extending from its back are great wings with long, beautiful feathers. Its head has the face of a human with keen, intelligent eyes and a long, flowing mane. Each individual has a very majestic appearance, projecting its power and belief in ultimate goodness.</p>
					<p>Celestial lammasu pride themselves on the number of languages they speak - they will use their <i>tongues </i>ability if necessary.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Celestial lammasu are creatures of tremendous power and prowess in battle. They will readily enter any combat where creatures of good alignment are being threatened by evil. At times, the Lions of the Mount will even come to the aid of nonevil neutrals warring against evil,</p>
					<p>The celestial lammasu's physical attack consists of two huge, raking paws that inflict <b>2-12 points of damage </b>per hit. Due to the nature of the celestial lammasu, their claw attacks can damage creatures normally only hit by magical weapons. A celestial lammasu can also - when flying - dive down on its opponent with two claw attacks gaining +2 on its attack roll and inflicting double damage (4-24 per claw).</p>
					<p>These outer planer denizens also have considerable spell power. They may cast priest spells as if they were 15th-level priests with major access to all spheres. In addition, they have the spell casting ability of a 12th-level wizard. They need not maintain spell lists as does a mortal wizard. Instead, they request their wizard spells daily from any school except necromantic.</p>
					<p>In addition to their spell casting abilities, celestial lammasu have the following spell-like powers that can be used once per melee round, one at a time, at 20th level effect:</p>
					<list>
						<li><i>cure light wounds</i></li>
						<li><i>cure serious wounds</i></li>
						<li><i>dispel evil</i></li>
						<li><i>dispel magic </i>, 7 times per day</li>
						<li><i>holy word </i>, 3 times per day</li>
						<li><i>plane shift</i></li>
						<li><i>protection from evil </i>, triple normal strength, extends around all good creatures within sight of the celestial lammasu</li>
						<li><i>teleport without error</i></li>
						<li><i>tongues </i>, always active</li>
						<li>wish, 1 time per day, only in times of dire need</li>
					</list>
					<p>Celestial lammasu are <b><u>immune to damage from nonmagical weapons and magical weapons of +3 or lesser enchantment </u></b>. They naturally regenerate 4 hit points per melee round.</p>
					<p>Celestial lammasu dwell in the layers of Olympus from which they wage constant war on evil throughout the outer and inner planes. They take special interest in lammasu on the Prime Material plane - the celestial lammasu provide guidance and occasional support to their mortal cousins. There are 36 celestial lammasu known to exist, each with its own true name.</p>
					<p>Once every 10 years, one of the celestial lammasus will attend a special meeting, called a Whitemoon, with certain lammasu of the Prime Material plane. In attendance are the leaders of all the lammasu prides for hundreds of miles around. The leaders discuss their efforts against evil with each other and with the celestial lammasu. During the night of this Whitemoon, the lammasu temple glows a brilliant white that can be seen for many miles - it becomes a scintillating focus of goodness. Any evil creature that comes within one mile of the temple is destroyed outright and any nonevil neutral that approaches within one mile of the temple is put magically to sleep for the duration of the night.</p>
					<p>One important note is that celestial lammasu do not directly serve a deity or power like the aasimons do. Although their actions serve the interests of the powers of good alignment, they are concerned only with their own personal wars on evil.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Celestial lammasu are above and outside the normal ecological cycle. They have absolutely no natural predatorial enemies. Too, they never feed on other life forms for sustenance; rather they draw nutrients directly from the goodness of the upper planes.</p>

					<p>The lich is, perhaps, the single most powerful form of undead known to exist. They seek to further their own power at all costs and have little or no interest in the affairs of the living, except where those affairs interfere with their own.</p>
					<p>A lich greatly resembles a wight or mummy, being gaunt and skeletal in form. The creature's eye sockets are black and empty save for the fierce pinpoints of light which serve the lich as eyes. The lich can see with normal vision in even the darkest of environments but is unaffected by even the brightest light. An aura of cold and darkness radiates from the lich which makes it an ominous and fearsome sight. They were originally wizards of at least 18th level.</p>
					<p>Liches are often (75%) garbed in the rich clothes of nobility. If not so attired, the lich will be found in the robes of its former profession. In either case, the clothes will be tattered and rotting with a 25% chance of being magical in some way.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Although a lich will seldom engage in actual melee combat with those it considers enemies, it is more than capable of holding its own when forced into battle.</p>
					<p><b><u>The aura of magical power which surrounds a lich is so potent that any creature of fewer than 5 Hit Dice (or 5th level) which sees it must save vs. spell or flee in terror for 5-20 (5d4) rounds </u></b>.</p>
					<p>Should the lich elect to touch a living creature, its aura of absolute cold will inflict <b>1-10 points of damage </b>. <b><u>Further, the victim must save vs. paralysis or be utterly unable to move </u></b>. This paralysis lasts until <i>dispelled </i>in some manner.</p>
					<p>Liches can themselves be <b><u>hit only by weapons </u></b>of at least +1, by magical spells, or by monsters with 6 or more Hit Dice and/or magical properties. The magical nature of the lich and its undead state make it utterly <b><u>immune to </u></b><b><i><u>charm </u></i></b><b><u>, </u></b><b><i><u>sleep </u></i></b><b><u>, </u></b><b><i><u>enfeeblement </u></i></b><b><u>, </u></b><b><i><u>polymorph </u></i></b><b><u>, </u></b><b><i><u>cold </u></i></b><b><u>, </u></b><b><i><u>electricity </u></i></b><b><u>, </u></b><b><i><u>insanity </u></i></b><b><u>, or </u></b><b><i><u>death </u></i></b><b><u>spells </u></b>. Priests of at least 8th level can attempt to turn a lich, as can paladins of no less than 10th level.</p>
					<p>A lich is able to employ spells just as it did in life. It still requires the use of its spell books, magical components, and similar objects. It is important to note that most, if not all, liches have had a great deal of time in which to research and create new magical spells and objects. Thus, adventurers should be prepared to face magic the likes of which they have never seen before when stalking a lich. In addition, liches are able to use any magical objects which they might possess just as if they were still alive.</p>
					<p>Defeating a lich in combat is difficult indeed, but managing to actually destroy the creature is harder still. In all cases, a lich will protect itself from annihilation with the creation of a phylactery in which it stores its life force. This is similar to a magic jar spell. In order to ensure the final destruction of a lich, its body must be wholly annihilated and its phylactery must be sought out and destroyed in some manner. Since the lich will always take great care to see to it that its phylactery is well hidden and protected this can be an undertaking fully as daunting as the defeat of the lich in its physical form.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Liches are usually solitary creatures. They have cast aside their places as living beings by choice and now want as little to do with the world of men as possible. From time to time, however, a lich's interest in the world at large may be reawakened by some great event of personal importance.</p>
					<p>A lich will make its home in some ominous fortified area, often a strong keep or vast subterranean crypt.</p>
					<p>When a lich does decide to become involved with the world beyond its lair, its keen intelligence makes it a dangerous adversary. In some cases, a lich will depend on its magical powers to accomplish its goals. If this is not sufficient, however, the lich is quite capable of animating a force of undead troops to act on its behalf. If such is the case, the lich's endless patience and cunning more than make up for the inherent disadvantages of the lesser forms of undead which it commands.</p>
					<p>Although the lich has no interest in good or evil as we understand it, the creature will do whatever it must to further its own causes. Since it feels that the living are of little importance, the lich is often viewed as evil by those who encounter it. In rare cases, liches of a most unusual nature can be found which are of any alignment.</p>
					<p>The lich can exist for centuries without change. Its will drives it onward to master new magics and harness mystical powers not available to it in its previous life. So obsessed does the monster become with its quest for power that it often forgets its former existence utterly. Few liches call themselves by their old names when the years have drained the last vestiges of their humanity from them. Instead, they often adopt pseudonyms like 'the Black Hand' or 'the Forgotten King.' Learning the true name of a lich is rumored to confer power over the creature.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>The lich is not a thing of this world. Although it was once a living creature, it has entered into an unnatural existence.</p>
					<p>In order to become a lich, the wizard must prepare its phylactery by the use of the <i>enchant an item </i>, <i>magic jar </i>, <i>permanency </i>and <i>reincarnation </i>spells. The phylactery, which can be almost any manner of object, must be of the finest craftsmanship and materials with a value of not less than 1,500 gold pieces per level of the wizard. Once this object is created, the would-be lich must craft a potion of extreme toxicity, which is then enchanted with the following spells: <i>wraithform </i>, <i>permanency </i>, <i>cone of cold </i>, <i>feign death </i>, and <i>animate dead </i>. When next the moon is full, the potion is imbibed. Rather than death, the potion causes the wizard to undergo a transformation into its new state. A system shock survival throw is required, with failure indicating an error in the creation of the potion which kills the wizard and renders him forever dead.</p>
					<p><b>Demilich</b></p>
					<p>The demilich is not, as the name implies, a weaker form of the lich. Rather, it is the stage into which a lich will eventually evolve as the power which has sustained its physical form gradually begins to fail. Inmost cases, all that remains of a demilich's body are a skull, some bones, and a pile of dust.</p>
					<p>When it has learned all that it feels it can in its undead life, the lich will continue its quest for power in strange planes unknown to even the wisest of sages. Since it has no use for its physical body at this point, the lich leaves it to decay as it should have done centuries ago.</p>
					<p>If the final resting place of a demilich's remains are entered, the dust which was once its body will rise up and assume a man-like shape. In the case of the oldest demiliches (25%), the shape will advance and threaten, but dissipate without attacking in 3 rounds unless attacked. Younger demiliches (75%) still retain a link to their remains, however, and will form with the powers of a wraith. This dust form cannot be turned. In addition, it can store energy from attacks and use this power to engage its foes. If the dust form is attacked, each point of damage which is delivered to it is converted to an energy point. Since the demilich will fall back and seem to suffer injury from each attack (though none is actually inflicted), its attackers are likely to press on in their attempts to destroy it. Once the demilich has acquired 50 energy points, it will assume a manifestation which looks much like the lich's earlier undead form and has the powers and abilities of a ghost, but which cannot be turned.</p>
					<p>If anyone touches the skull it will rise into the air and turn to face the most powerful of the intruders (a spell user will be chosen over a non-spell user). Instantly, it unleashes a howl which acts as a <i>death ray </i>, affecting all creatures within a 20' radius of the skull. <b><u>Those who fail to save vs. death are permanently dead </u></b>.</p>
					<p>On the next round, the demilich will employ another manner of attack. In order to attain the status of a demilich, a lich must have replaced 5-8 (1d4+4) of its teeth with gems. Each of these gems now serves as a powerful magical device which can <i>trap the soul </i>of its adversaries. The physical body of someone hit with the demilich's spell collapses and rots away in a single round. Once it has drained the life essence from the most powerful member of the party, the skull sinks back to the floor. If it continues to be challenged, the demilich can repeat this attack until all of its gems are filled. An <i>amulet of life protection </i>will prevail over the gem, but the character's body will perish regardless.</p>
					<p>In addition to the attacks mentioned above, a demilich can also pronounce a powerful curse on those who disturb it. These can be so mighty as to include: always being hit by one's enemies, never making a saving throw, or the inability to acquire new experience points. Demilich curses can be overcome with a <i>remove curse </i>, but the victim loses one point of charisma permanently when the curse is removed.</p>
					<p>The skull of a demilich is Armor Class -6 and has 50 hit points. It can be affected by spells in only a few ways: a <i>forget </i>spell will cause it to sink down without attacking (either by howling or draining a soul), a <i>dispel evil </i>will do 5-8 (1d4+4) points of damage to it, a <i>shatter spell </i>will inflict 3-18 (3d6) points of damage to it, a <i>holy word </i>pronounced against it will deliver 5-30 (5d6) points of damage, and a <i>power word kill </i>spell cast by an ethereal or astral wizard will cause the skull to shatter (destroying it).</p>
					<p>Most weapons will be unable to harm the skull of a demilich, but there are exceptions. A fighter or ranger with a <i>vorpal sword </i>, <i>sword of sharpness </i>, <i>sword +5 </i>, or vorpal weapon can inflict normal damage on the skull, as can a paladin with a vorpal or +4 weapon. Further, any character with a <b><u>+4 or better weapon or a </u></b><b><i><u>mace of disruption </u></i></b><b><u>can inflict 1 point of damage to the skull each time he strikes it </u></b>.</p>
					<p><b><u>Upon the destruction of the skull, those who have been trapped inside the gems must make a saving throw vs. spell </u></b>. Those who fail are lost forever, having been consumed by the demilich to power its magical nature. If the character survives, the gem glows with a faint inner light, and <i>true seeing </i>will reveal a tiny figure trapped within. If the throw is made the soul can be freed by simply crushing the gem. A new body must be within 10 yards for the soul to enter or it will be lost. Such a body might be a clone or simulacrum. (See spells of those names.)</p>
					<p>If the fragments of the destroyed skull are not destroyed by immersion in holy water and the casting of a <i>dispel magic </i>the demilich will reform in 1-10 days.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Archlich</b></p>
					<p>From time to time, sages have heard rumors of liches having alignments other than evil, and even lawful good liches apparently have existed. There have even been reports of priests who, in extreme circumstances, have become liches. These reports have recently been verified, but the archlich is as rare as Roc's teeth.</p>

					<p>Lillendi are natives of Ysgard, though they can travel astrally to the Prime and may also be found on the planes of Arborea and Limbo. On the Prime Material Plane, they prefer to dwell in temperate or tropical woodlands. They are peaceful and delight in song and conversation - and far from harmless. Those who offend lillendi may recieve harsh treatment at their hands, and even blameless individuals are subject to their pranks. Lillendi are particularly hostile toward those who seek to impose civilized order on the wilderness.</p>
					<p>A lillend has the torso, arms, and head of a comely man or woman, but also has broad, powerful, feathered wings and a stout serpentine body from the waist downwards. Though the humanlike portions of a lillend are of unremarkable hue, the feathered and scaled parts of its anatomy are brightly colored and strikingly patterned. Each individual has its own unique color combination and is quite proud of it. A lillend wears no clothing but sometimes wears jewelry. It always carries weapons and musical instruments.</p>
					<p>Lillendi do not mate or marry. They reproduce parthenogenically, giving birth to offspring that resemble the mother in most respects. Lillendi with male human torsos are biologically female, though they follow male human patterns of dress and customs.</p>
					<p>A lillend can understand any intelligent communication, including writing or sign language. All lillendi have infravision to 120 feet. Lillendi speak their own language and the languages of giants, bariaur, and githzerai.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Lillendi can cast spells, charm with music, affect morale, determine the history of legendary magical items as 7th-level bards, and they can use any magical items that bards can use. In addition to their bardic abilities, they can cast <i>darkness </i>, <i>hallucinatory terrain </i>, <i>knock </i>, and <i>light </i>each 3 times per day. Once per day they can cast <i>fire charm </i>, <i>Otto's irresistible dance </i>, <i>pass plant </i>, <i>polymorph self </i>(into humanlike form only), <i>speak with animals </i>, <i>speak with plants </i>, and <i>transport via plants </i>.</p>
					<p>Lillendi can breathe water and can move swiftly on or under the surface, wings folded tightly against the body when they snake their way across the surface. When they dive underwater their wings beat slowly to propel them forward, like enormous diving birds.</p>
					<p>They are <b><u>immune to poisons, noxious gases, normal fire, the effects of the Positive and Negative Energy Planes (including level draining and enervation), and to any musically based magical effect, such as harpy song or satyr piping </u></b>. They are unaffected by all enchantment/charm spells, and only <b><u>+1 or better weapons can strike them </u></b>.</p>
					<p>Lillendi have 17 Strength and 16 Dexterity for their human torsos, with attendant bonuses in combat. Their weapons, sometimes magical, are usually long swords, great spears, or powerful long bows with war arrows. A lillend catching an opponent in her serpentine coils inflicts <b>2d6 points of damage </b>that round and constricts each round thereafter for <b>2d6 points of damage </b>as she crushes the life out of her prey. Any creature held in a lillend's coils suffers a -3 penalty to attack, damage, and saving throw rolls. When a lillend attacks prey caught in her coils she does so at +1 to attack and damage rolls.</p>
					<p>Lillendi carry particularly unpleasant enemies in flight for up to 10 rounds, then drop them for a maximum of 20d6 points of falling damage. <b><u>Falls that inflict more than 50 points of damage require a saving throw vs. death magic to avoid instant death from massive damage, regardless of the character's remaining hit point total </u></b>. Lillendi cannot constrict while flying, and they cannot carry more than 250 pounds aloft.</p>
					<p>Those who go into battle to meet death fight more fiercely to make the best possible impression on the power they serve. Lillendi entering the Silent Hour (see below) strike in a calm, focused fury, always winning initiative and attacking at +4 for doubled damage, but they always perish at the end of the alotted span.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Lillendi serve the gods of the moon in the realm called Gates of the Moon, which lies on the plane of Ysgard. They only travel to the Prime when ordered to do so by their Powers. Of all the proxies of Ysgard, the lillendi are the least involved in the affairs of others.</p>
					<p>Lillendi are said to be able to choose the hour of their death, the Silent Hour, when they grow weary of life and service to the moon. This knowledge is either a gift from the gods of the moon, or a curse from the powers of Law, whom the lillendi are said to have served long ago and then abandoned. Shortly before her death, a lillend makes her farewells. As she dies she is absorbed into her power's realm, disappearing in a misty fog that acts as a combination <i>moonbeam </i>and <i>chaos </i>spell.</p>
					<p>Lillendi who haven't yet chosen the Silent Hour can still die through accident or violence, but in death their faces are always wracked with despair, for the legends say that those who do not pass through the Silent Hour are never joined with the power they serve.</p>
					<p>Lillendi social status depends on a simple system of initiations into mysteries and the ownership of certain totem masks. The mysteries are akin to secret societies, and each mystery is a specific kernel of wisdom passed on from one generation to the next. The more societies a lillend is a member of, the greater her status. Each society is devoted to particular musical forms, songs, instruments, and weapons, so a group of lillendi usually uses the same instruments, weaponry, and spells.</p>
					<p>The masks are tangentially related to the societies, since each mask design belongs to a specific family, and long ago each family lived in a single lodge and wore a single type of mask. Things have gotten a little more complicated since then, but the masks still roughly indicate status and family affiliations.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Lillendi devour both material food and magic essences. They can sustain themselves on moonbeams and the elemental essence of the wilderness (mountain breezes, gentle rains, raging rivers, and forest fires), though they prefer more substantial fare. If they gorge themselves on meat, they often remain in a torpid digestive state for hours or even days. This torpor doubles their spellcasting times, halves their constriction damage, and causes a -2 penalty to initiative. The lillendi enjoy this sluggishness, though they are wise enough not to go into such torpor alone and unguarded.</p>
					<p>Lillendi are known for broad tastes: They eat meat, vegetables, hay, grains, or spell components with equal abandon. Their digestion is complete and efficient; they excrete nothing though some say that the lillendi merely transmute matter into magical energy. Hunters and rangers have never found scat or markings in lillendi territory. It may be that anything indigestible is transformed into the fog that lillendi sometimes breathe out. Who knows?</p>
					<p>Lillendi feud with the petitioners of Ysgard from time to time, but more often keep to themselves. They are rivals of tht asuras, devas, and valkyries. They usually avoid the clumsy <i>fensir </i>(ysgardian trolls) easily. They are deadly enemies of the baatezu and modrons.</p>

					<p>The locathah are a humanoid race of aquatic nomads that roams warm coastal waters.</p>
					<p>A typical locathah stands 5 to 6 feet tall and weighs 150 to 200 pounds. The skin is covered in fine but tough scales. The scales vary in color from a ivory yellow on the stomach and neck to a pale yellow on the rest of the body. The fins of their ears and spine are ocher. The ear fins enhance hearing while the large eyes are designed to enhance underwater vision. The only way to distinguish males from females is a vertical ocher stripe marking the egg sac. On the surface, locathah have a typically fish-like smell. They speak their own language; 10% also speak merman, koalinth, or other aquatic languages.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>The intelligent locathah have developed tactics that enable them to beat their deadlier rivals. They always operate in teams, the larger the better. Furthermore, when away from their homes they ride giant eels that act as both mounts and allies.</p>
					<p>A typical locathah force is armed as follows:</p>
					<list>
						<li>Lance - 20%</li>
						<li>Crossbow - 30%</li>
						<li>Trident - 30%</li>
						<li>Short sword - 20%</li>
					</list>
					<p>Since a locathah lacks claws or teeth, it cannot do damage if it is disarmed. If that happens, it will either grapple a foe (if armed locathah are present), look for weapons, or flee. Locathah only battle to the death if cornered or if their home is threatened.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Locathah have developed a society similar to that of surface humans. They have a well-developed hunter-gatherer society and a strong sense of territory. Locathah make their lairs in rocks carved into castle-like strongholds. These aquatic castles are very similar to their surface counterparts. Openings are protected by stout doors, shutters, or coral bars. Often 4d4 moray eels are used as guardbeasts. There is a 50% chance that Portuguese man-o-war jellyfish may be used as traps. A herd of giant eels is kept at the edge of each stronghold.</p>
					<p>Locathah have a communal society organized in tribes of 20 to several hundred. Each band of forty locathah has a leader (18 hit points, treat as a 4th-level fighter) and four assistants (14 hit points, treat as 3rd-level fighters). Clans of more than 120 locathah are led by a female chieftain (22 hit points, treat as a 5th-level fighter) accompanied by 12 guards (12-14 hit points, treat as 3rd-level fighters).</p>
					<p>Clan chieftains are prolific egg layers. Eggs are gathered into well-guarded nurseries where they hatch after five to six months. Hatchlings are raised communally but each is assigned a 'parent', a non-warrior adult that takes personal responsibility for that hatchling.</p>
					<p>Locathah shamans are priests of up to the 3rd level.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Locathah are omnivorous. They have both aquatic farmers and hunter-gatherers that provide a varied diet for their clan brethren. The locathah's stone-age technology is limited to manufacturing weapons, tools, and ornaments from available materials. More advanced or magical items are scavenged from sunken wrecks, invaders, and drowning victims. Although they defend their territories against hostile invaders, locathah cooperate with nonhostile visitors, especially traders. Locathan coral carvings and jewelry are highly valued by art collectors and are traded for forged metals, ceramics, and durable magical items. Locathah can be hired to assist travelers in their realm. They also collect tolls from fishermen using locathah territorial waters.</p>
					<p>Locathah never voluntarily leave the water. They are almost helpless on land. They are limited to slow crawls because they are unused to supporting their own weight. The use of magic to fly or levitate will negate this helplessness. They risk swift suffocation as their gills dry out; after ten turns, a surfaced locathah suffers 1 point of damage each round. If the locathah immerses itself in water, the damage is halted.</p>
					<p>Locathah always try to recover captive locathah or their bodies. If such are detected aboard a ship, other locathah might first demand the return of their kin or simply sink the boat by carving into its bottom.</p>

					<p>Werebears are humans who can transform themselves into large brown bears. They are the best known good-aligned lycanthropes. The ursine form most often resembles a brown bear. Some have blond, reddish, black, or ivory fur (the latter is common in frozen regions).</p>
					<p>In human form they are large, stout, well-muscled, and hairy. Their brown hair is thick; males usually wear beards. Some have reddish, blond, ivory, or black hair; this matches the color of the ursine form. They dress in simple cloth and leather garments that are easily removed, repaired, or replaced.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>In human form, the werebear uses available weapons, preferring axes, and knives, since these have practical applications suitable for woodland life. If attacked in daylight, the werebear usually remains human unless death is likely. The shapechange renders the werebear helpless for a round. In ursine form, the werebear attacks with two swiping claws and a bite. If both claws hit, during the next round the werebear can hug for an additional <b>2-16 points of damage </b>. This subsequent damage continues automatically each round thereafter.</p>
					<p>Like those of other lycanthropes, the werebear's defenses function only in the bear form. Weapons used against the werebear must be either silver or magical weapons of +1 or better. Werebears can summon 1-6 brown bears within 2-12 turns, provided such animals are within one mile. Werebears heal at three times the normal human rate and can cure disease in another creature in 1-4 weeks if they so desire.</p>
					<p>If a werebear dies, he reverts to his human form in one round.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Werebears are normally solitary creatures. As humans, they build cabins far from settled areas, preferably in a deep forest near well-stocked waters. Werebears do not marry although they may have preferred mates they meet on a very irregular basis. Females bear 1-2 children in human form. Such children are very stout and grow quickly. Within eight years they gain adolescence and the ability to change into werebears. Shortly after, the mother drives the children out and seeks a mate to start the cycle anew. The newly independent young are discreetly guided and assisted by older werebears. Despite their apparent isolationism and rugged individualism, werebears have a sense of community. They never attack each other and aid any werebear threatened by another lycanthrope species.</p>
					<p>Werebears are closest to forest-dwelling classes like rangers, druids, and wildlife-oriented priests. They rarely enter villages and never enter cities except in dire emergencies or to help other good-aligned people, especially those threatened by evil lycanthropes. Werebears hate wererats and werewolves.</p>
					<p>The average werebear claims a territory 1 to 4 square miles in size. Fishing areas are open to all werebears. A werebear feels a close bond to its home region, acting as a game warden to protect its territory and the animals therein from the ravages of intruders.</p>
					<p>Werebears do not travel a great deal. Only the rare individual (usually young) can be coaxed into joining a band of adventurers. Werebears may join an adventuring group as guides, provided the money is right and the job is agreeable.</p>
					<p>Treasure is usually limited to small, valuable commodities like gold, platinum, gems, and jewelry. Werebears rarely carry any treasure and instead hide it near their homes. They also collect scrolls, potions, and other magical items, often as fees or rewards for past services. Werebears destroy any magical items that specifically affect lycanthropes or bears, since such items might be used against themselves.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Werebears are omnivorous, preferring fish, small mammals, and a honey-rich mead. This mead is extremely intoxicating to normal humans. Werebears have few natural enemies. Their closest enemies are the werewolves who share their preferred wilderness regions.</p>

					<p>Wereboars are humans who are able to transform themselves into a form combining human and boar features. Their tempers are as ugly as their features.</p>
					<p>In human form wereboars tend to be stocky, muscular people of average height. Their hair is short and stiff. They dress in simple garments that are easy to remove, repair, or replace.</p>
					<p>The boar form stands slightly taller than the human form, but the hunchbacked posture thrusts the head forward. The head is identical to a boar's head, complete with short tusks. The torso's diameter is doubled, the neck shortened, and the feet become hoof-like. Stiff, black hair like wire bristles covers the skin.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>The wereboar combines his hands and tusks for deadly effect. The wereboar seizes a target and pulls it toward his head. He stabs his tusks into the victim, then pulls his victim to one side while swinging his head in the other direction, which tears the wound further. He then tosses the victim aside and attacks someone else. A wereboar will gladly wade into the center of a group of opponents and then fight his way out.</p>
					<p>In human form the wereboar attacks with whatever weapon he has. Wereboars prefer bludgeoning or chopping weapons, such as axes and maces, rather than stabbing or missile weapons such as swords, spears, or bows.</p>
					<p>In either form the wereboar is <b><u>immune to damage from nonmagical and nonsilver weapons </u></b>. Such wounds are little more than scratches that quickly heal.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Wereboars are ill-tempered, easily angered, and almost as prone to attack their few friends as they are to attack an enemy. As humans they are rude, crude, and vulgar. However, they are invaluable allies in a fight. A wereboar does not give his friendship easily, but when he does it is a special bond he will not break. The problem is, due to the wereboar's peculiar personality, it is difficult to tell whether he is being friendly or hostile.</p>
					<p>Wereboars prefer dense woodlands, ideally far from towns and cities. Like werebears, they live in caves or build cabins for their homes. Their homes tend to be ill-kept and slovenly. Wereboars don't repair things, they replace them.</p>
					<p>Despite their personalities, wereboars have close-knit families. Females give birth to litters of 1d4+2 offspring. Newborns are very small by human standards but are strong and able to crawl hours after birth. The offspring mature quickly. When they reach adolescence at eight years, they gain the ability to become wereboars themselves. A wereboar father appears to be distant and aloof, but a staunch protector who will attack any foe who threatens his family, no matter how uneven the odds. Females are aggressive when defending their young (+2 bonus to attack roll). Neither males nor females check morale when defending their young.</p>
					<p>The diet is a mixture of small game, vegetables, and fungi. Their favorite food is the subterranean fungus called truffles; even in human form they can detect the truffles growing several feet underground. Wereboars aren't very good gardeners. A typical garden is a cleared field strewn with a variety of seeds and bulbs in the hope that something edible will grow. Wereboar cuisine is equally haphazard; it can be summed up as burned meat and stews.</p>
					<p>Wereboars avoid normal hogs and boars. They are suspicious of strangers. Wereboars assume everyone is hostile. In human form they may wait for the first attack, but when in boar form they usually (75% chance) chase the intruders away and attack any who defend themselves.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Wereboars produce little of value, whether trade goods or services. Their main desire is simply to stay away from everyone else. In the wild, they defend their territories against any intruders. Wereboars fit into orcish society as well as they do into human society, and might sometimes assist or ally themselves with orcish forces. Wereboars can tolerate half-orcs.</p>

					<p>Wererats, also called ratmen, are humans who can transform themselves into three forms - human, human-sized ratman, and giant rat. They are sly and evil, and usually inhabit tunnel complexes beneath cities.</p>
					<p>The wererat's human form tends to be a thin, wiry individual of shorter than average height. His eyes constantly dart around, and his nose and mouth may twitch if he is excited. Males often have thin, ragged moustaches.</p>
					<p>The ratman form is somewhat shorter than the human form. The head, torso, and tail are identical to those of a rat, but the limbs remain human.</p>
					<p>The third form is that of a giant rat 2 feet from nose to rump. This form is identical to that of the giant rat. This is the preferred form for travel and spying on potential victims.</p>
					<p>Wererats are often followed by 1-6 mice or rats that are instinctively drawn to them but are not controlled by them.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>In all three forms, wererats rely on weapons for their attacks, preferring shortswords and daggers. Anyone who is injured by a true wererat has a 1% chance per point of damage of becoming a wererat. In their ratman and giant rat forms, wererats can be hurt only by silver or magical weapons.</p>
					<p>Wererats prefer to attack from ambush. A favorite tactic is to assume human shape and lure unsuspecting victims into a trap. This is the only time wererats are voluntarily alone. Victims are then robbed, held for ransom, or eaten.</p>
					<p>Each wererat is able to summon and control 2-12 giant rats.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Wererats live in packs, regardless of form, never being alone if they can help it. Solitary wererats are either sole survivors or engaged in mischief. They do not form interpersonal bonds like love or marriage. In fact, wererats rarely mate with their own kind. Offspring of a wererat and a human woman are human, although they are small, like their fathers. Offspring of a female wererat resemble giant rats with human-like paws. These ratlings grow to maturity in two years and gain the ability to transform themselves into human children with an apparent age about three times that of the ratling's actual age.</p>
					<p>Wererats prefer subterranean lairs hidden among the sewers and catacombs beneath cities. Nothing can pass through the sewers and escape their attention. Unfortunately for the wererat, the sewer's stains and smells do not vanish when it assumes human form. This effectively limits wererats to the less savory sections of town as well as reducing the number of humans who might unknowingly mate with a wererat.</p>
					<p>Wererats see cities as their hunting grounds. They delight in matching their superior intellects and meager physical skills against the more powerful and numerous humans. But they are no fools; they will not attack unless they are sure they can win. If a battle is going against them, wererats will scatter, transform to rat form, and head for the sanctuary of the sewers. They won't even defend their own lairs. Their attitude is that since they had stolen most of their belongings in the first place, they can always replace them.</p>
					<p>Wererats are greedy and collect anything they think might have worth. The resulting trove usually has more junk than treasure, but a thorough search may reveal a wide variety of valuables.</p>
					<p>Wererats frequent sleazy taverns, both for the cheap alcohol and to follow drunks into the streets to drag them away for the next day's meal.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Wererats are parasites. They recognize that they are physically weaker than most species that dominate the surface. They have found and exploited the one niche where they have a chance to dominate, the world beneath the cities. They feed on humans and steal their riches. Humans unknowingly protect the wererats from both surface dwelling creatures and those who might burrow up from far below. Besides, the humans pay for the upkeep of the wererat's sewer realm.</p>
					<p>Psychologically, wererats remind humans that no matter how strongly defended they think they are, monsters can still get in. Mothers describe wererats as bogeymen to scare unruly children.</p>

					<p>Weretigers are humans, usually female, that have the ability to transform into tigerlike forms. They have a strong affinity for all felines.</p>
					<p>The human form tends to be sleekly muscular, taller than average, and very agile. The voices of weretigers are husky and they tend to roll their r's.</p>
					<p>The weretiger form is a hybrid between a human and a tiger. It is about 25% larger than the human form, and is covered by tiger-striped hide. A 3-foot tail extends from the spine. The legs are more feline than human; this form walks on its toes. The head is also a mixture of features. The ears, nose, muzzle, and teeth are tigerlike, but the eyes and overall shape are human. If the human form's hair is long, it is still present. The fingernails grow into claws. Despite the changes, the hybrid form can pass for human at a distance if properly disguised.</p>
					<p>The third form is that of a fully grown tiger without any trace of human features.</p>
					<p>Weretigers speak the languages of all feline breeds, so normal felines, including the great cats, have a 75% chance of being friendly toward a weretiger. Even feline monsters have a 25% chance of being automatically friendly. However, weretigers are rarely found in the company of real tigers, being only 5% likely to be accompanied by them.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>In either tiger form, the weretiger attacks with a variety of punches, raking claws, and bites. The weretiger's punches are so strong that they cause <b>1-4 points of damage </b>. Otherwise the claws can be raked across an opponent, causing <b>2-5 points of damage </b>. The teeth are the most dreadful weapon. They can tear a victim apart or crush a windpipe. Weretigers usually bite only in their full tiger form.</p>
					<p>In human form, the weretiger uses a wide variety of weapons with which it is adept. A weretiger is also good at unarmed combat; it retains its deadly punch in this form, as well as an enhanced sense of smell and night vision.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>For various reasons weretigresses outnumber weretigers five to one.</p>
					<p>Weretigers travel alone or in small prides. They do not marry but have preferred mates, which may be either humans or tigers. Weretigers give birth to one or two cubs. The cubs are the hybrid form; they look like fuzzy human babies with tails. Cubs mature quickly. They can crawl within days, walk within a month, and hunt within a year. Their physical size matches that of a human child of three times the same age. At age six, they reach adolescence and gain the ability to transform into a fully human form. At age 12, they gain the ability to assume a full-tiger form; this is considered the mark of adulthood.</p>
					<p>If a male weretiger mates with either a real tigress or human woman, the offspring initially has the same appearance as the mother. Lycanthropic transformations do not begin until the hybrid reaches adolescence.</p>
					<p>Weretigers are omnivorous. In the wild they roam a territory of 7-10 (1d4+6) square miles. Their homes are usually near human settlements. These tend to be well kept cabins with small herb and vegetable gardens. The only livestock will be a variety of cats and some poultry.</p>
					<p>Weretigers rarely live in confined settings such as cities or large towns because their lycanthropic nature would be hard to conceal. If found in such a setting, one or two weretigers in human form will be on an errand, such as a mission, a revel, or a simple shopping trip. In any form, weretigers are very confident and not prone to attack unless provoked.</p>
					<p>Treasure varies widely, acquired as payment for past services, plunder from past adventures, or scavenged from the remains of past opponents. Weretigers have an affinity for gems and often keep a small cache hidden somewhere near their homes.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Weretigers are the most adaptable of the lycanthropes. They are equally at home in human, feline, or monster company.</p>

					<p>Werewolves are the most feared of the lycanthropes, men who can transform into wolflike beasts. They should not be confused with wolfweres - wolves who turn into men. Great enmity exists between werewolves and wolfweres.</p>
					<p>The human forms of werewolves have no distinguishing traits. The werewolf form is equally varied. Many have a bipedal form that is a hybrid of human and lupine features. These creatures are about 1-foot taller and stronger than their human forms. The bodies are fur-covered and have short tails, wolflike legs, and heads that are combinations in varying degrees of human and lupine features.</p>
					<p>A second form of hybrid is more wolflike, and may be mistaken for a large wolf when it runs on all four legs. This hybrid can also walk erect and has humanlike hands.</p>
					<p>Another type of werewolf (about 20%) looks exactly like a large wolf about the size of a bear. This creature has no human features, although the eyes may glow red in the dark.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>In their human forms, werewolves attack with a variety of weapons, generally those common to their human identity and class. In the werewolf or wolflike forms, the creature attacks with its fearsome teeth. If the form has hands, the werewolf may grab its prey for a better bite.</p>
					<p>In the wolf form, the werewolf can be harmed only by silver or magical weapons of +1 or better. Wounds from other weapons heal too quickly to actually injure the werewolf.</p>
					<p>Werewolves attack in packs; packs including females and young drive the adults to hit harder. If the female is attacked, the male fights at +2 to hit and does full damage with each blow. If the young are attacked, the female attacks at +3 to hit and does full damage. Cubs with 60% full growth are -4 to hit, cubs with 70% are -3 to hit, and so on. All cubs inflict <b>2-5 points of damage </b>.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Werewolf packs roam the wilderness in search of human or other prey. True werewolves tend to be nomadic, although infected werewolves often continue to live the life to which they were accustomed. Werewolves retreat to their dens during the winter months or the years when the females are raising the helpless cubs. As humans, werewolves do not build homes, although they may take over existing dwellings, sometimes the home of past victims. Caves and burrows are the dens most commonly used in the wild. These sparsely furnished retreats are used mostly as a sleeping area and a place to store their human possessions. Many werewolf families roam the countryside in wagons, much like gypsies. In fact, this has caused many gypsies to be accused of being werewolves.</p>
					<p>Werewolves live in packs, generally related by bloodlines. Werewolf packs of five to eight individuals are single family groups consisting of a male, female, and three to six cubs, six to nine years old. Cubs under six years old are kept in secluded dens and never encountered by hostile humans.</p>
					<p>When pregnant, the female retreats with her mate and an older female who will act as midwife. In a very secluded area they prepare a special den that will be home for the mother and her cubs for the next six years. The female gives birth to a litter of 5-10 cubs. The cubs are born in the hybrid form; they resemble fuzzy human babies with wolflike faces. Infant mortality is high; 2-4 cubs of each litter never reach 60% growth. Cubs grow at the same rate as humans for their first five years. By the sixth year they attain 60% of their full growth. At this point they develop the ability to transform into their other forms. Each following year brings an increase of an additional 10% growth. Werewolves are considered mature at age 10.</p>
					<p>If a werewolf mates with a woman, the offspring is completely human. The temperament reflects the father; such children are violent, combative, and prone to mental illness. There is a 10% chance each year from the onset of adolescence that such a child will spontaneously transform into a true werewolf.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Werewolves are a peculiar hybrid of human and lupine personalities. They are savage killers, yet they are devoted to their close-knit families. Werewolves are hostile toward lycanthropes who oppose them, especially werebears.</p>

					<p>The manticore is a true monster, with a leonine torso and legs, batlike wings, a man's head, a tail tipped with iron spikes, and an appetite for human flesh.</p>
					<p>The manticore stands 6 feet tall at the shoulder and measures 15 feet in length. It has a 25-foot wingspan. Each section of the manticore closely resembles the creature it imitates. The leonine torso has a tawny hide, the mane is a lion's brown-black color, and the batlike wings are a dark brown with sparse hair. All manticores have heads that resemble human males; the mane resembles a heavy beard and long hair.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>The manticore first fires a volley of 1-6 tail spikes (180 yard range as a light crossbow). Each spike causes <b>1-6 points of damage </b>. The manticore can fire four such volleys each day (the spikes regrow quickly). Next, the manticore closes with its prey and attacks with its front claws and sharp teeth. In an outdoor setting, the manticore tries to stay in the air to minimize its chance of being attacked. It is a clumsy flier, however, and cannot use its teeth in the air.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Manticores are found in any climate but prefer warm lands to cool ones. This reflects the wide climate range of their favorite food, humans. A manticore's territory may cover 20 or more square miles and includes at least one human settlement. Such territories usually overlap with those of other manticores and other man-eating predators like dragons.</p>
					<p>Manticores mate for life. The male remains with the female during gestation and hunts for her. Manticores bear one or two cubs which grow rapidly to adulthood in five years. Cubs are born with 1 Hit Die and gain an additional one each year. In their first year, cubs lack flying ability, but they are still small enough for an adult to grasp in its forelegs. There is a 20% chance a she-manticore's lair holds cubs under one year old. Cubs up to two years inflict one point of damage per front paw and 1-2 points with their bite. Cubs 3-4 years old inflict 1-2, 1-2, and <b>1-6 points of damage </b>.</p>
					<p>Manticore cubs can be caught and trained to assist evil humans. Such training is difficult and dangerous, especially since domesticated adults have an 80% chance of reverting to a wild state. Manticores will not allow themselves to be used as mounts. Wild adults may voluntarily ally themselves with evil humans, provided such allies can provide them with a steady, ample food supply.</p>
					<p>Manticores normally eat their prey where they kill it. Males sometimes haul slain prey back to their mates or drag still-living prey to their lairs for the cubs to practice killing.</p>
					<p>Manticores collect their victims' valuables for a variety of reasons, including curiosity, emulation of other monsters who collect treasure, the man-scent on the things, or because they know humans value the things and therefore might come looking for them. Their lack of real hands prevents most manticores from using what magical items fall into their possession. However, manticores that have allied with evil humans may possess magical items designed specifically for their use. Examples include magical collars or bracelets that are, in effect, oversized magical rings.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Manticores are wide-ranging carnivores that have successfully survived in every region inhabited by humans, whether in the wilderness or underground. They are nightmarish opponents but invaluable allies if conditions are right. A manticore's pelt is a mark of the most powerful hunters and warriors. An intact, cured manticore hide complete with wings is worth 10,000 gp.</p>

					<p>Shadow mastiffs are native to the Demiplane of Shadow, appearing on the Prime Material Plane only when summoned by ambitious wizards and clerics. While on their home plane, shadow mastiffs roam at all times, returning to their lairs only after feeding. When summoned on the Prime Material, these creatures prowl at night or during times of darkness (such as eclipses), always seeking shelter just before light returns.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Creatures who are forced to fight a pack of shadow mastiffs typically find themselves in one of two positions: combat during near-dark or completely dark conditions, or fighting where light conditions work against the mastiffs.</p>
					<p>During darkened conditions, a shadow mastiff is at its most deadly peak. Each time the shadow mastiff strikes, it instantly blends back into the shadows, making it 40% likely that it cannot be seen and imposing a -4 penalty on its victim's attack rolls. A shadow mastiff that has successfully blended back into the shadows must be attacked physically or with area of effect spells; line-of-sight spells (such as <i>magic missile </i>) cannot be used unless some special method of locating the mastiff is used.</p>
					<p>During illuminated conditions, such as that created by a <i>continual light </i>spell or daylight (but not a normal <i>light </i>spell), the weaknesses of a mastiff becomes obvious. It loses its ability to hide in shadows, loses 4 hit points, its movement rate drops to 9, and its morale decreases to average (9).</p>
					<p>Regardless of light conditions, a howling pack of shadow mastiffs can cause panic in even the most resolute of warriors. <b><u>The baying power of a pack of mastiffs causes all creatures within 360 feet of a pack to run in fear away from the shadow mastiffs for 2d4 rounds unless a saving throw vs. spell is made </u></b>. Such a saving throw is made with a modifier based upon the number of shadow mastiffs in the pack. There must be at least four shadow mastiffs present to use their baying power.</p>

					<p>Those who fail their saving throws are 50% likely to drop anything held in their hands as they flee. While on the Demiplane of Shadow, saving throw modifiers for the mastiffs' baying power can increase to a -6 penalty if an exceptionally large pack of 20 or more of the creatures are encountered.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Shadow mastiffs are ruled by the most powerful mastiff in the pack, but there is little loyalty to the leader. Shadow mastiffs never suffer morale penalties for losing their leader, as another mastiff is always prepared to lead.</p>
					<p>The lair of a pack of shadow mastiffs is 50% likely to contain 2-5 whelps. These young are valued at around 200-500 gold pieces each. Bright light is fatal to whelps, however, so transportation of young shadow mastiffs is normally possible only through use of <i>continual darkness </i>or similar magic.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Sages have long believed that shadow mastiffs arise as the result of an animal being killed by an undead shadow. Upon its death, it is believed to be mystically transported to the Demiplane of Shadow where it joins with others of its kind.</p>

					<p>Medusae are female humanoids with hair of swarming snakes. They are hateful creatures that can petrify any creature that meets their gaze.</p>
					<p>The typical medusa has a pale-skinned, very shapely woman's form. It stands 5 to 6 feet tall with the snakes adding up to another foot. At distances farther than 30 feet, the medusa is easily confused with a normal woman. Its red-glowing eyes are visible up to 30 feet. At distances of 20 feet or closer, the medusa's true nature is revealed. Its face is horrible - the snakes writhe constantly, especially if the medusa is excited.</p>
					<p>Medusae wear human clothing such as loose dresses or robes. They seldom wear armor and cannot easily wear helmets. Medusae may carry a knife, dagger, or short bow. Medusae speak their own tongue and the common one.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>The medusa tries to get close to a victim before it reveals its true nature. It will use its attractive body to lure males nearer while staying in the shadows. Once the medusa is within 30 feet, it strikes, trying to get its victim to look into its eyes. <b><u>Any creature within 30 feet must make a saving throw versus petrification or turn instantly to lifeless stone </u></b>. If an opponent averts his eyes, the medusa rushes up so that its serpentine growths can attack. <b><u>The range of such attacks is only 1 foot, but the victim must save versus poison or die </u></b>.</p>
					<p>The medusa is able to see creatures in the Ethereal and Astral planes, and its petrifying gaze is equally as effective against creatures there. It retains its petrifying gaze after death. Creatures looking at a freshly-dead medusa's head make a saving throw at +1. The saving throw increases +1 each day the head decays.</p>
					<p>If the medusa cannot easily use its normal tactics, it may resort to normal weapons such as knives and shortbows.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Medusae dwell in dark caves or the lower regions of large abandoned buildings. They arrange the lighting such that their homes are filled with flickering shadows.</p>
					<p>The presence of petrified victims is a sure indicator of the occupant's true nature. For this, aesthetic, and other reasons, the medusa usually removes most of its victims. Those that resemble interesting statues may be retained; the rest are often broken into unrecognizable (and unrevivable) chunks.</p>
					<p>The one form of treasure never found in a medusa's lair is a mirror. If a medusa sees its own reflection in a mirror, it turns to stone itself. Reflection in nonmetallic reflectors such as water or polished stone have no such effect. Medusae are <b><u>immune to the petrifying effect of another medusa </u></b>.</p>
					<p>Medusae are infrequently driven to mate with humanoid males. The act always ends in the male's death, usually by petrification when the medusa reveals its previously hidden visage. Two to six eggs are laid one month later and hatch eight months after that. The female hatchlings appear as baby girls with stubby green tendrils. The hatchlings are revolting to look at but cannot petrify. Medusae grow at the same rate as humans. At about age two the serpentine hair becomes alive and gains its poisonous bite. The medusa can petrify with the onset of adolescence.</p>
					<p><b>Greater Medusa (Serpentine)</b></p>
					<p>Rare medusae (10%) have serpentine bodies in place of the lower torso and legs. The entire body is covered with fine scales and measures 10 to 20 feet. The poison of these medusae is so deadly that saving throws are made at -1, and they are known to use bows and poisoned arrows. <b><u>Their blood is so poisonous, in fact, that even after one has been killed, touching its body still requires a saving throw versus poison </u></b>. They seldom venture far from their lairs, since they are immediately recognizable. Greater medusae have a morale bonus of +1.</p>

					<p>Minotaurs are either cursed humans or the offspring of minotaurs and humans. They usually dwell in underground labyrinths, for they are not confused in these places, which gives them an advantage over their prey.</p>
					<p>Minotaurs are huge, well over 7 feet tall, and quite broad and muscular. They have the head of a bull but the body of a human male. Their fur is brown to black while their body coloring varies as would a normal human's. Clothing is minimal, usually a loin cloth or skirt.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Minotaurs are very strong (equivalent human Strength of 18). Against man-sized opponents (minimum 6 feet tall) they may butt for <b>2-8 points of damage </b>. Against smaller opponents, they bite for <b>1-4 points of damage </b>. If a minotaur is 30 feet or more from its opponent, it can lower its head and charge against any creature that is at least 6 feet tall. If successful, the charge causes double head-butt damage. In addition to these attacks, most minotaurs also carry weapons - a huge axe (treat as a halberd) or flail, with which it inflicts normal damage +2.</p>
					<p>Minotaurs are not particularly intelligent, but are extremely cunning and have excellent senses. They have a +2 bonus on their surprise rolls, have infravision, and can track prey by scent like a ranger, with 50% accuracy. They always pursue an unfamiliar scent. Minotaurs are <b><u>immune to maze spells </u></b>. They attack any intruder without fear, and will retreat only if the creature is obviously beyond their ability to defeat (+3 to morale score in combat).</p>

					<p>Minotaurs live in communities of up to eight members. If the community contains more than six minotaurs, one will be an elder minotaur with 18/50 Strength and 8+4 Hit Dice. The minotaur elder is the clan leader; he remains in the center of the labyrinth and raises young minotaurs while others hunt. He is always encountered in the center of a labyrinth.</p>
					<p>A minotaur's labyrinth is rarely natural. Often an evil wizard or a tyrant will construct a labyrinth and place the minotaur family there, feeding it prisoners and slaves on a regular basis.</p>
					<p>Occasionally this tyrant will be killed and the minotaurs forced to fend for themselves; since creatures rarely enter a labyrinth on their own accord, these minotaurs will usually be ravenously hungry.</p>
					<p>Minotaurs speak their own primitive language and are 25% likely to speak a halting form of common. They have little culture; their lives resemble animals more than humans. Their culture venerates physical strength above all else and particularly strong human fighters have been known to earn their respect. They worship crude gods and have weak clerics (maximum 3rd-level shaman). Rumors persist of more intelligent minotaurs with developed societies.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>The curse which creates minotaurs is unknown, but sages suspect it involves 'crimes against the natural order'. Minotaurs are always male. It is also said that the first minotaur was originally a great and ill-tempered human fighter; he wanted to be as strong as a bull and his wish was granted in the most hideous manner possible. Minotaurs breed with human females to produce offspring, which are male minotaurs. Minotaurs have a lifespan of 200 years. They can live without food for years at a time, but are always hungry unless they are fed regularly. They are meat-eaters, but their curse causes them to prefer a diet of human flesh. Those transformed into minotaurs by curses may be restored to human form by a <i>wish </i>, but those who were born as minotaurs cannot be made human. Gnolls are their natural enemies; they will kill each other on sight.</p>
					<p>Minotaur components are sometimes used in spells and potions, and might be used in magical items involving strength, location, and misdirection.</p>

					<p>Monkey is a truly unique being. Once he was an official of the Celestial Bureaucracy in the Outer Planes. However, for his tricks and mischief, the Celestial Emperor stripped him of much of his power and banished him to Toril on the Prime Material plane.</p>
					<p>Monkey can take many different forms, but generally restricts himself to a human appearance or his natural form. This is of a human with a monkey's face, dressed in robes finer than those of the greatest Shou mandarin. He has impeccable manners. (Although by the standards of the Celestial Court he is crude and profane.)</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Monkey never fights unless he wants to; with his powers it is impossible to force him into a battle. When he does choose battle, he will either fight to kill (against evil opponents) or fight to embarrass and humiliate his enemy. In physical combat, he can make five attacks in a single round, striking with his sword at blinding speed. He can only be hit by +3 weapons or better and regenerates at the rate of 5 hit points per round.</p>
					<p>Even more formidable, though, are his magical powers. Monkey has the innate ability to cast almost any magical spell. The only ones denied him are <i>wishes </i>, those that summon creatures from other planes, and those involving planar travel. Beyond these restrictions he can use any other spell he desires simply by thinking about it. He needs no components, gestures, or the like. Given this power, he is virtually unbeatable in combat.</p>
					<p>Although he functions as if he had 20 hit dice, Monkey cannot truly be killed, this being one of the conditions of his banishment. If his physical form is destroyed, he is reborn, hale and well, with the next dawn.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Fortunately for the world, Monkey is not interested in power or domination. Indeed, he has developed a paternal attitude toward the beings of this littie island he is stranded upon. If attacked by the inhabitants, he is more likely to teleport his foes to the top of a mountain or onto a lonely island than to kill them outright (which would not be hard for him).</p>
					<p>It is difficult to say what does motivate Monkey. He is a trickster, a gadfly to the great powers of the outer planes. He has stolen the Peaches of immortality, battled the Animal Kings, studied the Seven Great Disciplines under the Nine Masters, shaved the beard of the Lord of the Dead, and committed many other pranks too numerous to mention. Although these jests have enraged the greater powers, Monkey shows no fear or sincere remorse for committing them. Even being banished for his pestiferous deeds has not dulled his wit or mischievous nature. There is no doubt that were he returned to the Celestial Bureaucracy tomorrow, he would immediately resume his old ways, and probably be banished again the day after.</p>
					<p>Indeed, if Monkey has any failing, it is his lack of 'common sense'. He boasts when others know it will get him in trouble. He lies outrageously and without conscience. He commits deeds certain to get him in trouble and makes no effort to hide his involvement in the most outlandish events. He cheerfully taunts his enemies, humiliating them in front of their equals. None of these have earned him many friends among the celestial officials.</p>
					<p>Monkey's treasure is not one that can be carried away. Although he has many magical items and great wealth, he does not consider these important. Knowledge and information are true treasures. As a reward for services, Monkey typically answers one to three questions. These can be about anything on Toril, for nothing except the doings of his fellow celestial powers is hidden from him.</p>
					<p>His exploits have earned him a place in the myths of Shou. He is hailed as a comic folk hero by the peasants. in him they have a figure who strikes back at corrupt officials in the name of the peasantry. Many a Robin Hood bandit has taken the name Monkey as his own.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>What does a godlike being eat? Monkey can live on the very air. He does have a taste for rich food, fruits, and wine. He can eat prodigious quantities without filling himself. It is not a good idea to offer to cook for him.</p>

					<p>Mummies are corpses native to dry desert areas, where the dead are entombed by a process known as mummification. When their tombs are disturbed, the corpses become animated into a weird unlife state, whose unholy hatred of life causes them to attack living things without mercy.</p>
					<p>Mummies are usually (but not always) clothed in rotting strips of linen. They stand between 5 and 7 feet tall and are supernaturally strong.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Mummies are horrific enemies. A single blow from one's arm inflicts <b>1-12 points of damage </b>, and worse, its scabrous touch infects the victim with a rotting disease which is fatal in 1-6 months. For each month the rot progresses, the victim permanently loses 2 points of Charisma. The disease can be cured only with a <i>cure disease </i>spell. <i>Cure wounds </i>spells have no effect on a person inflicted with mummy rot and his wounds heal at 10% of the normal rate. A regenerate spell will restore damage but will not otherwise affect the course of the disease.</p>
					<p><b><u>The mere sight of a mummy causes such terror in any creature that a saving throw versus spell must be made or the victim becomes paralyzed with fright for 1 to 4 rounds </u></b>. Numbers will bolster courage; for each six creatures present, the saving throw is improved by +1. Humans save against mummies at an additional +2.</p>
					<p><b><u>Mummies can be harmed only by magical weapons, which inflict only half damage (all fractions round down) </u></b>. <i>Sleep </i>, <i>charm </i>, <i>hold </i>, and cold-based spells have no effect. Poison and paralysis do not harm them. A <i>resurrection </i>spell will turn the creature into a normal human (a fighter at 7th level ability) with the memories of its former life; or will have no effect if the mummy is older than the maximum age the priest can resurrect. A <i>wish </i>will also restore a mummy to human form but a <i>remove curse </i>will not.</p>
					<p>Mummies are vulnerable to fire, even nonmagical varieties. A blow with a torch inflicts <b>1-3 points of damage </b>. A flask of burning oil inflicts <b>1-8 points of damage </b>on the first round it hits and 2-16 on the second round. Magical fires are +1 damage/die. Vials of holy water inflict <b>2-8 points of damage </b>per direct hit.</p>
					<p>Any creature killed by a mummy rots immediately and cannot be raised from death unless both a <i>cure disease </i>and a <i>raise dead </i>spell are cast within six rounds.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Mummies are the product of an embalming process used on wealthy and important personages. Most mummies are corpses without magical properties. On occasion, perhaps due to powerful evil magic or perhaps because the individual was so greedy in life that he refuses to give up his treasure, the spirit of the mummified person will not die, but taps into energy from the Positive Material plane and is transformed into an undead horror. Most mummies remain dormant until their treasure is taken, but then they become aroused and kill without mercy.</p>
					<p>A mummy lives in its ancient burial chamber, usually in the heart of a crypt or pyramid. The tomb is a complex series of chambers filled with relics (mostly nonmagical). These relics include models of the mummy's possessions, favorite items and treasures, the bodies of dead pets, and foodstuffs to feed the spirit after death. Particularly evil people will have slaves or family members slain when they die so the slaves can be buried with them. Because of their magical properties, mummies exist on both Prime and Positive Material planes.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>To create a mummy, a corpse should be soaked in a preserving solution (typically carbonate of soda) for several weeks and covered with spices and resins. Body organs, such as the heart, brain, and liver, are typically removed and sealed in jars. Sometimes gems are wrapped in the cloth (if the treasure listing for the mummy indicates it possesses gems, a few may be placed in the wrappings). Mummies are not part of the natural ecosystem and have no natural enemies.</p>
					<p>Mummy dust is a component for rotting and disease magical items.</p>

					<p>Dark naga are fey creatures who have human-like faces (with fanged mouths) on leathery, snake-like bodies. They usually work with other evil beings for mutual gain or survival. Dark naga tend to be black, purplish-black, or very dark blue in hue, and their crested heads and smooth, almost invisible scales make them look like gigantic eels more than snakes.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Dark naga have natural <i>ESP </i>powers (80' range), and use this ability constantly.</p>
					<p><b><u>Dark naga have a (non-poisonous) bite and a poisonous tail-sting; the barbed stinger does physical damage, and any struck being must save vs. poison or take 1-2 hp additional damage and fall into a drugged sleep (onset time 1 round, sleep lasts 2d4 rounds) </u></b>.</p>
					<p>The most feared ability of dark nagas is their power to wield magic. A dark naga casts spells as a 6th-level wizard (4,2,2), and employs only verbal spells. It may learn these spells from dragons, phaerimm, or other creatures who can cast spells with but a word or thought (act-of-will spells, as opposed to spell-like natural powers, can easily be altered into verbal-release magics. but the devising of a verbal-only version of a spell that normally has somatic and material components is not nearly so simple a matter). It may devise new spells, or verbal-only spell versions, itself by means of experimentation. Either means of acquiring new magics is slow and expensive, and this can often force dark nagas into servitude to a stronger evil creature or anyone who hires them, or into the life of an adventurer.</p>
					<p>Dark naga are <b><u>immune to the effects of all known (normal and magical) acids, venoms, and poisons </u></b>. Some have been known to swallow poisons and act as a courier, spitting up the dangerous liquid when they deliver it to its destination. They can spit poison that they are so carrying up to 10' distant at any opponent; this requires a successful attack roll, and takes the place of their bite, though a naga can elect to bite and then release the poison as it does so, combining the damage.</p>
					<p>In battle, a dark naga may use its sting and either a spell or a bite in the same round. If space permits, the naga can direct its sting and bite against the same foe, but it is quite intelligent enough to direct attacks at multiple opponents, even attacking foes in front of and behind it, simultaneously, if caught between them in a narrow passage.</p>
					<p>Dark nagas cannot be mind-read; their <i>ESP </i>ability somehow renders them <b><u>immune to the </u></b><b><i><u>ESP </u></i></b><b><u>-like probes of others </u></b>. They are subject but <b><u>resistant to </u></b><b><i><u>charm </u></i></b><b><u>, </u></b><b><i><u>sleep </u></i></b><b><u>, </u></b><b><i><u>hold </u></i></b><b><u>and similar enchantment/charm spells, receiving a +2 bonus to all saving throws against this school of magic </u></b>.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Dark nagas lair in rocky places, such as caverns or ruins; they like to have a home where they can hide things (such as treasures and spellbooks), that has more than one entry or exit, and at least one place narrow enough that they can block it with their body, and singlehandedly fight off intruders. Dark nagas are fond of traps, and will devise these (or hire other creatures to install them) whenever possible.</p>
					<p>Dark nagas tend to be loners, but can form stable family groups of two or three; they are bisexual, and give birth to a squirming mass of many wormlike young which they promptly abandon to fend for themselves. Intelligent enough to know they can prevail against few creatures in the Realms alone, dark nagas work with other evil creatures, such as orcs, hobgoblins, drow, phaerimm, beholders, and the like. They like to fill a 'commander and magical strike force' role, perhaps in a sergeant-like intermediary rank, under a more powerful ruler - but they are wise enough to adopt the faith, beliefs, and rules of whatever group they join.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Dark naga do not willingly eat other dark naga, but they will eat just about anything else, both alive and dead. They eat a few lichens and the occasional green plant, but their main diet is meat. They especially prize hot, still-fresh blood.</p>
					<p>Dark nagas spend their lives outwardly working with, or serving, others. Whenever possible, however, they also pursue private goals, which may be as whimsical and odd as some human goals ('cover this desert valley with trees', for instance), but always include increasing their personal power by acquiring new spells and magical items. Dark nagas are quick to plunder fallen foe, swallowing items, scrolls, and spellbooks to spit forth later - for all dark nagas have a bag-like internal organ that they can use to carry things. This organ has thick, rubbery air-sac walls to protect the naga against sharp points and the like, but it also protects the cargo against digestive juices, and has the unusual side-effect of shielding magic from all <i>detection </i>spells.</p>

					<p>Possessing high intelligence and magical abilities, naga are snake-like creatures with human heads. They prefer warmer climates and tend not to wander far from their lairs.</p>
					<p>The cold-blooded naga have glittering scales and grow to an adult length of 10 to 20 feet. Their lidless eyes are bright and wide, almost luminescent, and their spines are armored with sharp triangular extensions that grow in a line from the napes of their necks to the tips of their tails. Wise and patient, these creatures can stay still for hours but move swiftly when alarmed. They favor resting in a semi-aware state that conserves their energy and makes them very hard to surprise. Occasionally, naga fashion a pouch to carry items under their chins. Both land types have a distinctive smell that pervades their lair and nearby areas.</p>
					<p>Naga can usually speak four or more languages.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Naga often set traps to snare trespassers. Magical spells are always attempted first, since naga have few melee skills. Once their magic is expended, naga rely on their poisonous bites - only the largest of these creatures can actually constrict victims like a giant snake.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Naga live solitary lives, hunting or foraging over an area usually only a quarter mile square. They favor dwelling in a deep hole, but sometimes are found curled up in ruins or in a darkened room. While the sexes are impossible to tell apart, there is a 10% chance that an encounter includes one or more mates. These matings are temporary, as a pregnant naga quickly leaves the male to hide her eggs in a secluded spot. Young naga resemble giant snakes until they reach adulthood; then their human-like head emerges after a long and painful molting.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>While naga do not produce trade goods, their lives span many human generations and they keep a detailed oral history, so they are good sources of information. They are often protectors of treasures or artifacts for centuries. Their hides can be fashioned into <i>scale mail +2 </i>, and their eyes and teeth have been sold for use in arcane spells.</p>
					<p><b>Guardian Naga</b></p>
					<p>Surrounded with a flowery sweet scent, the guardian naga is marked by green-gold scales, silvery spines, and flashing golden eyes. It is so called because its lawful good nature makes it a perfect sentinel over a like-aligned being's treasure or some evil. This naga always warns off trespassers, and often buries those defeated in battle. <b><u>The guardian naga can spit poison at an individual attacker at up to 30-foot range, and the poison kills all who fail their saving throws vs. poison </u></b>. In addition to a poisonous bite and constriction, these naga have the ability to use priest spells as 6th-level priests.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Spirit Naga</b></p>
					<p>These black-and-crimson-banded naga have a most human-like head, with stringy hair and deep brown eyes, and they smell of rotting flesh, which happens to be their preferred food! Hiding in deserted ruins or caverns, these evil and cunning spirit naga seek to cause harm to any creature that passes through their domains. They set traps and frequently attack without warning. <b><u>While they are not big enough to constrict their prey, they have a poisonous bite, a gaze that charms (as a charm spell) all those who look into their eyes and fail a saving throw vs. paralyzation, and can use wizard spells at 5th-level ability and priest spells at 4th-level ability </u></b>.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Water Naga</b></p>
					<p>The beautiful water naga are emerald green to turquoise in reticulated patterns with chocolate brown and pale jade green or dark grey and olive, and their spines have red spikes that raise like hackles when they are angry. Their eyes are pale green to amber. These naga are found in clear, fresh water. Curious but neutral in attitude, water naga seldom attack unless threatened. In addition to their poisonous bite that inflicts <b>1d4 points of damage </b>, these naga have 5th-level wizard spell abilities. They never know spells that deal with fire.</p>

					<p>Possessing high intelligence and magical abilities, naga are snake-like creatures with human heads. They prefer warmer climates and tend not to wander far from their lairs.</p>
					<p>The cold-blooded naga have glittering scales and grow to an adult length of 10 to 20 feet. Their lidless eyes are bright and wide, almost luminescent, and their spines are armored with sharp triangular extensions that grow in a line from the napes of their necks to the tips of their tails. Wise and patient, these creatures can stay still for hours but move swiftly when alarmed. They favor resting in a semi-aware state that conserves their energy and makes them very hard to surprise. Occasionally, naga fashion a pouch to carry items under their chins. Both land types have a distinctive smell that pervades their lair and nearby areas.</p>
					<p>Naga can usually speak four or more languages.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Naga often set traps to snare trespassers. Magical spells are always attempted first, since naga have few melee skills. Once their magic is expended, naga rely on their poisonous bites - only the largest of these creatures can actually constrict victims like a giant snake.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Naga live solitary lives, hunting or foraging over an area usually only a quarter mile square. They favor dwelling in a deep hole, but sometimes are found curled up in ruins or in a darkened room. While the sexes are impossible to tell apart, there is a 10% chance that an encounter includes one or more mates. These matings are temporary, as a pregnant naga quickly leaves the male to hide her eggs in a secluded spot. Young naga resemble giant snakes until they reach adulthood; then their human-like head emerges after a long and painful molting.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>While naga do not produce trade goods, their lives span many human generations and they keep a detailed oral history, so they are good sources of information. They are often protectors of treasures or artifacts for centuries. Their hides can be fashioned into <i>scale mail +2 </i>, and their eyes and teeth have been sold for use in arcane spells.</p>
					<p><b>Guardian Naga</b></p>
					<p>Surrounded with a flowery sweet scent, the guardian naga is marked by green-gold scales, silvery spines, and flashing golden eyes. It is so called because its lawful good nature makes it a perfect sentinel over a like-aligned being's treasure or some evil. This naga always warns off trespassers, and often buries those defeated in battle. <b><u>The guardian naga can spit poison at an individual attacker at up to 30-foot range, and the poison kills all who fail their saving throws vs. poison </u></b>. In addition to a poisonous bite and constriction, these naga have the ability to use priest spells as 6th-level priests.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Spirit Naga</b></p>
					<p>These black-and-crimson-banded naga have a most human-like head, with stringy hair and deep brown eyes, and they smell of rotting flesh, which happens to be their preferred food! Hiding in deserted ruins or caverns, these evil and cunning spirit naga seek to cause harm to any creature that passes through their domains. They set traps and frequently attack without warning. <b><u>While they are not big enough to constrict their prey, they have a poisonous bite, a gaze that charms (as a charm spell) all those who look into their eyes and fail a saving throw vs. paralyzation, and can use wizard spells at 5th-level ability and priest spells at 4th-level ability </u></b>.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Water Naga</b></p>
					<p>The beautiful water naga are emerald green to turquoise in reticulated patterns with chocolate brown and pale jade green or dark grey and olive, and their spines have red spikes that raise like hackles when they are angry. Their eyes are pale green to amber. These naga are found in clear, fresh water. Curious but neutral in attitude, water naga seldom attack unless threatened. In addition to their poisonous bite that inflicts <b>1d4 points of damage </b>, these naga have 5th-level wizard spell abilities. They never know spells that deal with fire.</p>

					<p>Night hags inhabit the Gray Waste and, practically speaking, rule it. They are wretched females with hideous dark blue-violet skin, jet black hair, and glowing red eyes; long, wicked claws on their hands and feet; and foul rotting fangs protruding from their dry, festering lips.</p>
					<p>Night hags speak multiple languages, preferring those that help them in their dealings with evil beings.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Night hags, thoroughly evil, attack any good creature without cause if they feel they have a reasonable chance of victory.</p>
					<p><b><u>A night hag can bite ( 2d6 damage </u></b><u>and save vs. poison or contract a disease) </u>. Night hags also have a bewildering variety of spell-like abilities they can use one at a time, once per turn, at will: <i>know alignment </i>, <i>magic missile </i>(4 missiles, 5 times per day), <i>polymorph self </i>, <i>ray of enfeeblement </i>(3 times per day), and <i>sleep </i>. A night hag's powerful <i>sleep </i>spell affects selfishly evil monsters or characters up to 12 Hit Dice or 12th level unless the victim saves vs. spells. The hag strangles her sleeping victim and takes its spirit to the Gray Waste as a larva, where it becomes a macabre form of currency.</p>
					<p>If the <i>sleep </i>spell fails, the night hag visits the evil victim nightly in ethereal form, which it can assume at will, intruding on the victim's dreams and riding on the victim's back until dawn. In this way the night hag hopes to drive the victim mad. The victim cannot remove the night hag, and each nightly ride permanently drains 1 from the victim's Constitution. When the victim's Constitution reaches zero, the victim dies, and the night hag returns to the Waste with the larval life force. The only way to defeat a riding night hag is to destroy it either in its normal or ethereal form. Both the <i>sleep </i>and dream intrusion work only against a mortal who displays selfish evil.</p>
					<p>Night hags are <b><u>immune to the effects of </u></b><b><i><u>charm </u></i></b><b><u>, </u></b><b><i><u>sleep </u></i></b><b><u>, </u></b><b><i><u>fear </u></i></b><b><u>, fire-, and cold-based attacks </u></b>. A silver, cold iron, or <b><u>+3 or better weapon is needed to harm them </u></b>.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Night hags rule the Waste by default. They round up and herd larvae for barter with fiends of all types. Tanar'ri and baatezu alike require larvae for their quasits and imps, and some liches use larvae to maintain their undead condition.</p>
					<p>Night hags are said to see the multiverse as a place of eternal conflict. They believe it is unwise to form permanent alliances, for those who rule today are apt to be slaves tomorrow. Nevertheless, their keen minds and perfect memories cause many to seek the hags for wisdom and counsel.</p>
					<p>Night hags are always willing to trade for knowledge, magical items, and spirits. However, if those trading with them do not match or exceed the hags in strength, the hags later track them down and make them into larvae.</p>
					<p>Some lords of the Lower Planes take night hags for wives. From such unions are only born more night hags, equal to others of their race and not partaking of the characteristics of their sire. It is said that occasionally hags travel to other planes, assume the forms of beautiful women, and become wives of powerful wizards, that they might thereby gain further secrets of the universe.</p>
					<p>Hags have no particular hatred for any one race or type of beings, even their own. Their inability to form permanent alliances is probably the only thing that has kept them from wielding greater power on the Lower Planes. Likewise, the only thing that keeps a hag's cruelty in check is her burning desire to know all things. Certain human colleges were founded by night hags, and some research projects - even those carried out by the most moral of wizards - have been ultimately found to be financed by hag gold.</p>
					<p>Very few beings have ever outwitted a hag. In such cases the hag spends years coming up with an intricate plot to outtrick the trickster. Night hags do remember any kindness shown to them, as well, but they appear less motivated to repay it.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Night hags are the only lower-planar inhabitants that actually seek out humans and kill them for their spirits. They destroy any life form they can overpower. Night hags are mercilessly wicked.</p>
					<p>Night hags carry a special periapt called a <i>charm of blackness </i>. Created by hags deep in the pits of the Waste, they instantly cure any disease the possessor contracts and gives a +2 bonus to all saving throws. If a good creature gains a <i>charm </i>, it functions but shatters after ten uses. Night hags lose their ability to become ethereal without their periapt, but the ability does not transfer to others. Hags go to great pains to retrieve lost periapts; it takes one month and 100 larvae to create another.</p>

					<p>Nightmares, the evil steeds of the Lower Planes, serve as mounts for baatezu, tanar'ri, night hags, and powerful undead lords. They look like large, powerful horses with a jet black coat. Nightmares have glowing red eyes, flaming orange nostrils, and hooves that burn like embers. Their long manes and tails are ragged and wild. They understand commands from evil riders and communicate among themselves by empathy.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Nightmares hate all life. They often attack any non-lower-planar creature they encounter (and sometimes lower planar creatures, too). Their fangs inflict <b>2d4 damage </b>, their two burning front hooves each inflict <b>1d6+4 damage </b>and ignite combustibles.</p>
					<p>During combat, excitement causes the nightmare to emit a hot cloud of noxious vapors that blinds and chokes all within 10'. <b><u>Victims must save vs. paralyzation or take a -2 penalty on their attack and damage rolls </u></b>.</p>
					<p>Although they have no wings, nightmares can magically propel themselves through the air at an impressive rate. They fly through the Astral and Ethereal Planes at will.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Nightmares serve many lower-planar creatures. They are intelligent and cannot be treated as casually as a horse. They willingly serve as mount for any mission involving evil. However, for the unwary rider a nightmare's own ambitions can prove insurmountable. These hateful steeds often do what they want rather than follow the wishes of their 'master'. A nightmare poses the same problems as magical weapons with large egos.</p>
					<p>Any non-native on the Lower Planes can attract the attention of a nightmare to secure it as a mount. The process, which involves several spells as well as an offering for the creature's service, requires a mage or specialist wizard of at least 5th level. The following spells must all be cast by the same spellcaster: <i>mount </i>(to attract the nightmare's attention); <i>monster summoning III </i>(to bind it to service); and <i>wall of fog </i>. The nightmare comes galloping through the fog, nostrils flaring and eyes gleaming. Lastly, the master must make the steed an offering: oat-like flakes made from platinum (200 gp value). Whoever feeds the oats to the nightmare becomes its master for 72 hours.</p>
					<p>Creatures of the Lower Planes do not perform these steps to summon a nightmare. No mortal sage knows what dark agreement they make for a nightmare's service.</p>
					<p>Once per year on the plane of the Gray Waste, its denizens meet in a dark and sinister Gloom meet to debate how to spread their will for the next year. Nightmares announce the Gloom meet. For two weeks before the Meet, nightmare frequency changes from very rare to uncommon. Immediately before the meeting, the nightmares herald it by riding the planes in a terrifying charge.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Nightmares have no biological link to true horses. A nightmare is a minion of evil, without need of food or air. Nightmares are listed as carnivores because they eat fallen foes. However, nothing indicates that the nightmares derive sustenance from this; more likely, they gain their strength through service to evil.</p>
					<p>It is said that when nightmares die of 'natural causes' - if indeed anything that happens to such creatures of evil can be called 'natural' - they go to the Hill of Bone in the Gray Wastes to die. There, among the bones of their ancestors' ancestors, they lie down to die. Some of the great stallions have arranged for honor guards to pick up their bodies - even if on other planes. The wizard Nephrosis Curwen claimed to have visited the Hill of Bone:</p>
					<p>'I had seen the hill from afar - the only white area in the Gray Wastes. I flew my broom to it, and was immediately struck hy the relative quiet of the place, as opposed to the incessant cries of the Hordlings. The Hill was very tall, and at first I took the skeletons to be those of horses. From time to time I heard a neigh or snort, and thought that perhaps there were horses nearby. Then I realized that it was the skulls themselves making the noise. Some vitality, some evil force remained in them.</p>
					<p>'While examining the skeletons, I was surprised by a wall of fog forming near the base of the hill scarce sixty feet from me. I recognized the sound of a nightmare's hooves, for often I had summoned such steeds in a similar manner.</p>
					<p>'I hid myself behind a large pile of legbones to observe the phenomenon. A very ancient stallion came through the fog. His back was bowed, and silvery hair marked his otherwise ehon coat. He came at a canter, as opposed to the great gallop in which they normally appear. He neighed once very loudly, and every skull on the Hill of Bone answered him in a deafening call. Then he lay down and died, almost instantly.</p>
					<p>'I assumed it would not be wise to remain here, and continued my quest.'</p>

					<p>So beautiful that a glimpse can blind or even kill a man, the nymphs are the embodiment of loveliness, a triumph of nature.</p>
					<p>A nymph's beauty is beyond words - an ever-young woman with sleek figure and long, thick hair, radiant skin and perfect teeth, full lips and gentle eyes. A nymph's scent is delightful, and her long robe glows, hemmed with golden threads and embroidered with rainbow hues of unearthly magnificence. A nymph's demeanor is graceful and charming, her mind quick and witty. Nymphs speak their own musical language and the common tongue.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Neutral in their alliances and cares, nymphs do not fight, but flee if confronted by an intruder or danger. Nymphs are able to cast <i>dimension door </i>once per day, and can employ druidical priest spells at 7th ability level, giving a nymph four 1st, two 2nd, two 3rd, and one 4th level spell once per day. <b><u>Looking at a nymph will cause permanent blindness unless the onlookers save versus spell </u></b>. <b><u>If the nymph is nude or disrobes, an onlooker will die unless a saving throw versus spell is successful </u></b>.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>These beautiful females inhabit only the loveliest of wilderness places, clear lakes and streams, glacier palaces, ocean grottoes, and crystalline caverns. Nymphs prefer a solitary existence, but very occasionally a few will gather together in a place of spectacular charm, though these rendezvous seldom last for more than a few months. Animals of all types flock to a nymph to be petted and caressed, forgetting their natural enemies to gather around the lovely creature.</p>
					<p>There is a 10% chance that a nymph will be friendly if approached by a good creature without the latter first glimpsing the nymph, by calling or other prior notice. On the other hand, if a nymph sees a human male with 18 Charisma and good alignment before he sees her, it is 90% probable that the nymph will be favorably inclined toward the man. It is still necessary to make saving throws upon sighting the nymph.</p>
					<p>Nymphs hate ugliness and evil and sometimes will help to defeat it. Any treasure they possess has usually been given to them by some lovesick man.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Like a druid, a nymph believes in the sanctity of nature and her environment and will try to keep her lair safe and pure. She will heal wounded animals and mend broken trees and plants. Sometimes she will even help a human in distress (5% chance). Since nymphs live for many generations, they can provide a wealth of information on the history of an area and often know secret places, hide-outs, and entrances long forgotten. If a man is kissed by a nymph, all painful and troubling memories are forgotten for the rest of the day - this may be a boon to some and a curse to others. A lock of nymph's hair can be used to create a powerful sleeping potion or, if enchanted and woven into a cloth and sewn into a garment, will magically add one point to the wearer's Charisma. The tears of a nymph can be used as an ingredient in a <i>philter of love </i>. If a woman bathes in a nymph's pool, her Charisma is increased by two points until she bathes again.</p>

					<p>The oozes, slimes and jellies of the underworld are hideous, amorphous creatures that are the bane of all that lives, dissolving the weapons, armor, and flesh of their victims.</p>
					<p><b>Ochre Jelly</b></p>
					<p>This monster resembles a giant amoeba, seeping through darkened corridors, through cracks and under doors, searching for flesh or cellulose to devour. Their form allows them to travel on walls and ceilings and drop on unsuspecting prey.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>The ochre jelly attacks by attempting to envelop its prey. Its secretions dissolve flesh, inflicting <b>3-12 (d10+2) points of damage </b>per round of exposure. While a <i>lightning bolt </i>will divide the creature into one or more smaller jellies, each doing one-half normal damage, fire- and cold-based attacks have normal effects.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>An asexual creature, the ochre jelly is a solitary beast that is occasionally found with its own divided offspring. It lives only to eat and reproduce.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Voraciously dissolving all types of carrion and trash, this monster is sometimes tolerated in inhabited subterranean areas for its janitorial services, but this activity is difficult to organize and is usually not appreciated by the inhabitants because of its danger.</p>

					<p>A slimy horror that looks like wet stone or a sedimentary rock formation, the gray ooze is rarely thicker than six or eight inches, but sometimes grows to a length of 12 feet. It cannot climb walls or ceilings, so it slides, drips, and oozes along cavern floors.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>The gray ooze strikes like a snake, and can corrode metal at an alarming rate (chain mail in one round, plate mail in two, and magical armor in one round per each plus to Armor Class). Spells have no effect on this monster, nor do fire- or cold-based attacks. Lightning and blows from weapons cause full damage. Note that weapons striking a gray ooze may corrode and break.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>After a large meal, a gray ooze reproduces by 'budding': growing a small pod that is left behind in a corridor or cavern. This pod takes two to three days to mature and then the little gray ooze absorbs its leathery shell and begins slithering about, searching for a meal. Sometimes more than one of these monsters are found together, but this is just a random event because they are not intelligent.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>The gray ooze is a dungeon scavenger. It is rumored that metalworkers of extraordinary skill keep very small oozes in stone jars to etch and score their metal work, but this is a delicate and dangerous practice.</p>
					<p><b>Crystal Ooze</b></p>
					<p>This creature is a variety of gray ooze which has adapted to living in water. It is 75% invisible when immersed in its natural element. It is translucent, mostly glassy clear, with an occasional milky white swirl in its substance.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Crystal ooze strikes like a snake, then attempts to flow over a victim and exude its paralyzing poison. Unlike its cousin, the gray ooze, this creature does not corrode metal, but its poisons attack wood, cloth, and flesh. Unless a victim successfully saves vs. poison, he becomes paralyzed and will be consumed by the crystal ooze in a short time. When prey is reduced to -20 hit points, it is totally consumed. Crystal ooze cannot be harmed by acid, cold, heat, or fire attacks, but electricity and <i>magic missiles </i>inflict full damage. Blows from weapons inflict only 1 point of damage per hit. <b><u>A wooden weapon must save vs. acid or it will dissolve and break </u></b>.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Crystal oozes live in any dim or dark body of water, though they can exist out of water for several hours. They reproduce by budding, like the gray ooze, but the crystal pods usually take seven to 10 days to hatch. Crystal oozes will eat their offspring, but occasionally, if the body of water is large enough and food is not scarce, a few of them might be found living in the same water.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Crystal oozes are scavengers that leave metal and stone objects in their wake, so incidental treasure can often be found around and in their lairs.</p>
					<p><b>Gelatinous Cube</b></p>
					<p>So nearly transparent that they are difficult to see, these cubes travel down dungeon corridors, absorbing carrion and trash along the way. Their sides glisten, tending to leave a slimy trail, but gelatinous cubes cannot climb walls or cling to ceilings. Very large cubes grow tall to garner mosses and the like from ceilings.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>A gelatinous cube attacks by touching its victim with its anesthetizing slime. <b><u>A victim who fails to save vs. paralyzation is paralyzed (anesthetized) for 5-20 (5d4) rounds </u></b>. The cube then surrounds its prey and secretes digestive fluids to absorb the food. All damage is caused by these digestive acids. Because gelatinous cubes are difficult to see, others are -3 on their surprise roll. Electricity, <i>fear </i>, <i>holds </i>, paralyzation, <i>polymorph </i>, and sleep-based attacks have no effect on this monster, but fire and blows from weapons have normal effects. If a cube fails its saving throw against a cold-based attack, the cube will be slowed 50% and inflicts only <b>1-4 points of damage </b>.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Possessing no intelligence, gelatinous cubes live only for eating. They prefer well- traveled dungeons where there is always food to scavenge. These creatures reproduce by budding, leaving clear, rubbery cubes in dark corners or on heaps of trash. Young are not protected and are sometimes reabsorbed by the parent. Treasure is sometimes swept up by a gelatinous cube as the creature travels along a cavern floor; any metals, gems, or jewelry are carried in the monster's body until they can be ejected as indigestible. Items found inside a cube include treasure types J, K, L, M, N, Q, as well as an occasional potion, dagger, or similar object.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>The gelatinous cube is sometimes encouraged to stay in a certain area for its scavenging abilities, and is preferred over other jellies and oozes since its square shape does not allow it to slither under doors and into areas in which it is not desired.</p>
					<p><b>Green Slime</b></p>
					<p>A hideous growth, green slime is bright green, sticky, and wet. It grows in dark subterranean places on walls, ceilings and floors.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>This slime cannot attack but is sensitive to vibrations and often drops from the ceiling onto a passing victim. Green slime attaches itself to living flesh and in 1-4 melee rounds turns the creature into green slime (no resurrection possible). Green slime eats through one inch of wood in an hour, but can dissolve metal quickly, going through plate armor in three melee rounds. The horrid growth can be scraped off quickly, cut away, frozen, or burned. A <i>cure disease </i>spell kills green slime, but other attacks, including weapons and spells, have no effect.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Green slime hates light and feeds on animal, vegetable, and metallic substances in dark caverns. Since it cannot move, this slime grows only when food comes to it. Sunlight dries it out and eventually kills it. Occasional huge slimes or colonies of dozens have been reported.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Green slime is an infestation that all creatures avoid; it is burned out of caverns or mines if found. Once it has infected an area, it has a tendency to grow back, even after being frozen or burned away, because dormant spores can germinate years later.</p>

					<p>The dreaded 'cuttlefish' are the scourge of ocean-going sailors and fishermen. Malicious and cunning, giant octopi have been known to attack ships, sinking smaller craft and stealing crew members from the larger ships.</p>
					<p>Giant octopi change their color to blend into their surroundings, and the range of colors and patterns available to them is extensive, from green to deep black, blue speckles and red stripes. Tentacles are often disguised as seaweed. Once camouflaged, there is only a 10% chance to detect them, and usually it is their eyes that give them away. Normal coloration is grey to brown, and their vicious beaks are a deep yellow with a bright orange mouth and tongue.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>An octopus will readily attack swimmers or small vessels in order to eat the crew. Several have been known to cooperate in order to overwhelm a larger ship, and any craft seized by these monsters loses way and comes to a full stop in three turns.</p>
					<p>A giant octopus generally attacks with six of its eight tentacles, using two to anchor itself. Each striking tentacle causes <b>1d4 points of damage </b>, but unless the member is loosened or severed, it constricts for <b>2d4 points of damage </b>every round after striking. If a victim is dragged close enough to the beak, the monster can bite for <b>2d6 points of damage </b>.</p>
					<p>Any victim under 8 feet tall or long can be struck by only one tentacle at a time, and the chance that both upper limbs are pinned on a successful strike is 25%, while the chance that both upper limbs are free is also 25%. When both upper limbs are held, the victim has no attack; if only one limb is held the victim attacks with a -3 penalty to its attack roll; if both limbs are free (i.e., the tentacle is wrapped around the victim's body) then the victim attacks with a -1 penalty to its attack roll. Tentacles grip with a Strength of 18/20. Any creature with a Strength equal to or greater than 18/20 can grasp the tentacle and negate its constriction. This does not free the victim, and the octopus will immediately seek to drag the victim to its mouth to eat it. To break free, a tentacle must be severed; this requires 8 points of damage. (These hit points are in addition to those the octopus gains from its 8 Hit Dice.)</p>
					<p>Once three or more tentacles are severed, it is 90% probable that the octopus will retreat, ejecting a cloud of black ink 40 feet high by 60 feet wide by 60 feet long. This ink cloud completely obscures the vision of any creature within it. The wounded octopus then camouflages itself in its lair or a nearby hiding place. It takes the monster two to three months to grow back severed tentacles.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>While octopi cooperate to attack a food source, they live a solitary existence, preferring to shelter in warm water of medial to shallow depth. Lairs are made in wrecked ships and undersea caves; any treasure found there is just an incidental leftover from previous meals. Consummate hunters, these monsters have great patience and cover a very small area, waiting for their food to come to them. Mating season comes every spring. Like most marine animals, octopi leave their eggs in a reef to fend for themselves.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>When prey is scarce, or if it has been wounded, an octopus turns to scavenging, eating everything from small crustaceans to seaweeds. Survival is paramount with this monster. It prefers to hunt at night, and often a man missing during the late night watch has been grabbed by a giant octopus, pulled quickly over the side, and eaten.</p>
					<p>Giant octopi's leathery hide is tough and waterproof, and it is worked into fine rain ponchos by sailors lucky enough to catch and kill one. Another byproduct of these monsters is their ink - they are most often hunted for this commodity. Giant octopus ink can be used to pen magical scrolls.</p>

					<p>Ogres are big, ugly, greedy humanoids that live by ambushes, raids, and theft. Ill-tempered and nasty, these monsters are often found serving as mercenaries in the ranks of orc tribes, evil clerics, or gnolls. They mingle freely with giants and trolls.</p>
					<p>Adult ogres stand 9 to 10 feet tall and weigh 300 to 350 pounds. Their skin colors range from a dead yellow to a dull black-brown, and (rarely) a sickly violet. Their warty bumps are often of a different color - or at least darker than their hides. Their eyes are purple with white pupils. Teeth and talons are orange or black. Ogres have long, greasy hair of blackish-blue to dull dark green. Their odor is repellent, reminiscent of curdled milk. Dressing in poorly cured furs and animal hides, they care for their weapons and armor only reasonably well. It is common for ogres to speak orc, troll, stone giant, and gnoll, as well as their own guttural language. A typical ogre's life span is 90 years.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>In small numbers, ogres fight as unorganized individuals, but groups of 11 or more will have a leader, and groups of 16 or more usually include two leaders and a chieftain. Ogres wielding weapons get a Strength bonus of +2 to hit; leaders have +3, chieftains have +4. Females fight as males but score only <b>2-8 points of damage </b>and have a maximum of only 6 hit points per die. Young ogres fight as goblins.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Ogre tribes are found anywhere, from deep caverns to mountaintops. Tribes have 16-20 males, 2-12 females, and 2-8 young. Shamans, if present, will be of 3rd level, and have access to the spheres of combat, divination, healing, protection, and sun (darkness only). Ogres live by raiding and scavenging and they will eat anything. Their fondness for elf, dwarf, and halfling flesh means that there is only a 10% chance that these will be found as slaves or prisoners. There is a 30% chance that an ogre lair will include 2-8 slaves. Captured prisoners are always kept as slaves (25%) or food (75%). Extremely avaricious, ogres squabble over treasure and cannot be trusted, even by their own kind.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Ogres consistently plague mankind, lusting for gold, gems, and jewelry as well as human flesh. They are evil-natured creatures that join with other monsters to prey on the weak and favor overwhelming odds to a fair fight. Ogres make no crafts nor labor.</p>
					<p><b>Ogre Leader</b></p>
					<p>When more than 11 ogres are encountered, a leader will be present. He is a 7 Hit Dice monster with 30-33 hit points and Armor Class 3. He inflicts 5-15 (2d6+3) points of damage per attack, +6 with weapon.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Ogre Chieftain</b></p>
					<p>If 16 or more ogres are encountered, they will be led by two patrol leaders and a chieftain. The chieftain is a 7 Hit Dice monster with 34-37 hit points and Armor Class 4. He inflicts 8-18 (2d6+6) points of damage per attack, +6 with weapon. Chieftains are usually the biggest and smartest ogres in their tribes.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Ogre Mage</b></p>
					<p>The oriental ogre has light blue, light green, or pale brown skin with ivory horns. The hair is usually a different color (blue with green, green with blue) and is darker in shade; the main exception to this coloration is found in ogre magi with pale brown skin and yellow hair. They have black nails and dark eyes with white pupils. The teeth and tusks are very white. Ogre magi are taller and more intelligent than their cousins and they dress in oriental clothing and armor.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Ogre magi can perform the following feats of magic: <i>fly </i>(for 12 turns), <i>become invisible </i>, <i>cause darkness </i>in a 10-foot radius, <i>polymorph </i>to a human or similar bipedal creature (4 feet to 12 feet tall), and <i>regenerate </i>one hit point per round (lost members must be reattached to regenerate). <b><u>Once per day they can do the following: </u></b><b><i><u>charm person </u></i></b><b><u>, </u></b><b><i><u>sleep </u></i></b><b><u>, </u></b><b><i><u>assume gaseous form </u></i></b><b><u>, and create a </u></b><b><i><u>cone of cold </u></i></b><b><u>60 feet long with a terminal diameter of 20 feet, which inflicts 8-64 (8d8) points of damage (save vs. spell for half damage) </u></b>. Oriental ogres attack with magic first and resort to physical attacks only if necessary. They are +1 on morale.</p>
					<p>In battle, ogre magi prefer the naganata (75%) or scimitar and whip (25%). Those found in oriental settings might (25%) possess ki power or have mastered a martial arts form. As ogre magi are intelligent, they will not fight if faced with overwhelming odds, but will flee to gather their forces or hide.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>These monsters live in fortified dwellings or caves and foray to capture slaves, treasure, and food. Ogre magi priests of up to 7th level have been reported. Tribes are small, with 2-5 females and 1-3 children that will not fight, but rather seek to escape in gaseous form. These monsters are extremely protective of their young and will battle with savage abandon to save one's life. If a young ogre mage is captured, these creatures will pay high ransom for its return, but they will seek revenge and will never forget the insult of the kidnaping.</p>
					<p>If encountered in their lair, ogre magi will be led by a chief of great strength (+2 on each Hit Die, attacking and saving as a 9 Hit Dice monster). Treasure is divided by this chief and his trove is always the richest. The tribe will have their own clan symbol typical to the oriental lands, and this symbol will be stitched on its war banners and flags as well as on armor and headdresses. The chief will often have the tribe's symbol tattooed on his forehead or back.</p>
					<p>Ogre magi speak the common tongue, their own special language, and the speech of normal ogres.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Ogre magi magical armor is too large to fit a man. This monster's lair is usually a powerful structure that can be expanded into a mighty fortress if it can be rid of its original owners.</p>
					<p><b>Merrow (Aquatic Ogre)</b></p>
					<p>Faster and fiercer than their land kin, the freshwater merrow are greenish and scaled with webbed hands and feet. Their necks are long and thick, their shoulders are sloping, and they have huge mouths and undershot jaws. Merrow have black teeth and nails and deep green eyes with white centers, and their hair resembles slimy seaweed. About 10% grow ivory horns, especially the more powerful males.</p>
					<p>Aquatic ogres are very fond of tattoos, and females may have their entire bodies inked with scenes of death and destruction as a sign of status. Merrow speak their own dialect and the language of other ogres.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Using their green coloration, aquatic ogres can hide, becoming effectively invisible 10-80% of the time, depending on terrain. They attack from cover, so others are -5 on their surprise roll. Merrow typically attack with a large piercing spear (inflicting <b>2-12 points of damage </b>) in a swimming charge at +1 to hit, followed by melee with talons and teeth.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>A typical merrow tribe consists of:</p>
					<list>
						<li>1 chief, AC3, 6+6 Hit Dice, +2 on damage</li>
						<li>2 patrol leaders, AC3, 5+5 Hit Dice, +1 on damage</li>
						<li>2-24 standard merrow</li>
						<li>2-24 females, AC5, 3+3 Hit Dice, 1-2/1-2/ <b>1-6 damage</b></li>
						<li>1-12 young, AC6, 2+2 Hit Dice, 1-2/1-2/ <b>1-4 damage</b></li>
						<li>1 shaman of 3rd level ability</li>
					</list>
					<p>Merrow dwell in caves in shallow, fresh water (50-250 feet deep), often with scrags (see Troll). They can live out of water for about two hours, so they often forage on land. Merrow usually control an area with a radius of 10-15 miles, hunting and foraging throughout this territory. In times of scarcity, or when the lure of treasure becomes too great, a war party will attack the coastal villages of man. Merrow prefer gold and jewels and often overlook dull magical items in search of glittering prizes. The goals of a merrow chieftain rule the tribe, and these power-hungry monsters seek to completely control their 'kingdoms', often leading to attacks on intruding ships.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Merrow are ignorant and superstitious and have no skills but plundering and murder. Areas of the freshwater lakes and seas where they have influence are avoided by sailors and fishermen. These monsters are carnivores, preying on all who enter their regions, often emptying the seas of life with their voracious appetites.</p>

							<p>Hundreds of variations on the battle axe exist. Generally, any heavy axe that can be used one-handed or two-handed falls into this category.

In some cases, both blades are equal in size in weight and can be used interchangeably.</p>

					<p>Orcs are a species of aggressive mammalian carnivores that band together in tribes and survive by hunting and raiding. Orcs believe that in order to survive they must expand their territory, and so they are constantly involved in wars against many enemies: humans, elves, dwarves, goblins, and other orc tribes.</p>
					<p>Orcs vary widely in appearance, as they frequently crossbreed with other species. In general, they resemble primitive humans with grey-green skin covered with coarse hair. Orcs have a slightly stooped posture, a low jutting forehead, and a snout instead of a nose, though comparisons between this facial feature and those of pigs are exaggerated and perhaps unfair. Orcs have well-developed canine teeth for eating meat and short pointed ears that resemble those of a wolf. Orcish snouts and ears have a slightly pink tinge. Their eyes are human, with a reddish tint that sometimes makes them appear to glow red when they reflect dim light sources in near darkness. This is actually part of their optical system, a pigment which gives them infravision. Male orcs are about 51/2 to 6 feet tall. Females average 6 inches shorter than males. Orcs prefer to wear colors that most humans think unpleasant: blood red, rust red, mustard yellow, yellow green, moss green, greenish purple, and blackish brown. Their armor is unattractive besides - dirty and often a bit rusty.</p>
					<p>Orcs speak Orcish, a language derived from older human and elvish languages. There is no common standard of Orcish, so the language has many dialects which vary from tribe to tribe. Orcs have also learned to speak local common tongues, but are not comfortable with them. Some orcs have a limited vocabulary in goblin, hobgoblin, and ogre dialects.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Orcs are constantly in battle. They use the following weapons.</p>
					<list>
						<li>sword and flail 5%</li>
						<li>sword and spear 10%</li>
						<li>axe and spear 10%</li>
						<li>axe and polearm 10%</li>
						<li>axe and crossbow 10%</li>
						<li>axe and bow 10%</li>
						<li>sword and battleaxe 5%</li>
						<li>spear 10%</li>
						<li>axe 10%</li>
						<li>polearm 20%</li>
					</list>
					<p>Polearms are typically either halberds, pikes (set to receive charge), or glaives. Leaders typically possess two weapons. If a subchief is present, there is a 40% chance the orcs will be fighting around a standard. The presence of this standard increases attack rolls and morale by +1 for all orcs within 60 yards. Orcs typically wear studded leather armor and a shield (AC 6).</p>
					<p>Orcs hate direct sunlight and fight at -1 penalty to their attack rolls in sunlight. Their morale decreases by 1 under these circumstances as well. Orcs employ sniping and ambush tactics in the wild. They do not obey the 'rules of war' unless such is in their best interests; for example, they will shoot at those who attempt to parlay with them under a white flag unless the orc leader feels it is advantageous to hear what the enemy has to say. They abuse human rules of engagement and chivalry to their best advantage. They have a historic enmity against elves and dwarves; many tribes will kill these demihumans on sight.</p>
					<p>It is often believed that orcs are so bloodthirsty and cruel that they are ineffective tacticians and that they would rather be vicious than victorious. Like most stereotypes, this is highly misleading; it is true for some orc tribes but not for all. Many orc tribes have waged wars for decades and have developed a frightening efficiency with battle tactics.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>For every three orcs encountered, there will be a leader and three assistants. These orcs will have 8 hit points each, being the meanest and strongest in the group. If 150 orcs or more are encountered there will be the following additional figures with the band: a subchief and 3-18 guards, each with Armor Class 4, 11 hit points, and +1 damage due to Strength on all attacks. They fight as monsters of 2 Hit Dice (THAC0 19). For every 100 orcs encountered, there will be either a shaman (maximum 5th level priest) or a witch doctor (maximum 4th-level mage). Shamans and witch doctors gain an extra 1d4 hit points for each level above 1st and fight as a monster of 1 Hit Die for every two levels (round fractions up) of spell-casting ability (e.g., a 5th-level shaman has d8+4d4 hit points and fights as a 3 Hit Dice monster.)</p>
					<p>If the orcs are not in their lair, there is a 20% chance they will be escorting a train of 1-6 carts and 10-60 slave bearers bringing supplies, loot, or ransom and tribute to their orc chief or a stronger orc tribe. The total value of the goods carried by all of the carts will vary between 10 and 1,000 silver pieces, and each slave bearer will bear goods valued between 5 and 30 silver pieces. If the orcs are escorting a treasure train, double the number of leaders and assistants and add 10 orcs for each cart in the train; one subchief with 5-30 guards will always be in charge.</p>
					<p>Orc lairs are underground 75% of the time, in a wilderness village 25% of the time. Orc communities range from small forts with 100-400 orcs to mining communities with 500-2,000 orcs to huge cities (partially underground and partially above ground) with 2,000 to 20,000 orcs. There will always be additional orcs when the encounter is in a creature's lair: a chief and 5-30 bodyguards (AC 4, 13-16 hit points, attack as monsters with 3 Hit Dice (THAC0 17) and inflict an extra +2 damage on all attacks due to Strength). If the lair is underground, there is a 50% chance that 2-5 ogres per 200 orcs will be living with them. Most lairs above ground are rude villages of wooden huts protected by a ditch, log rampart and log palisade, or more advanced constructions built by other races. The village will have 1-4 watch towers and a single gate. There will be one ballista and one catapult for every 100 adult male orcs.</p>
					<p>Orcs are aggressive. They believe other species are inferior to them and that bullying and slavery is part of the natural order. They will cooperate with other species but are not dependable: as slaves, they will rebel against all but the most powerful masters; as allies they are quick to take offense and break agreements. Orcs believe that battle is the ideal challenge, but some leaders are pragmatic enough to recognize the value of peace, which they exact at a high price. If great patience and care are used, orc tribes can be effective trading partners and military allies.</p>
					<p>Orcs value territory above all else; battle experience, wealth, and number of offspring are other major sources of pride. Orcs are patriarchal; women are fit only to bear children and nurse them. Orcs have a reputation for cruelty that is deserved, but humans are just as capable of evil as orcs. Orcs have marriage customs, but orc males are not noted for their faithfulness.</p>
					<p>Orcs worship many deities (some who have different names among different tribes); the chief deity is usually a giant, one-eyed orc. Orcish religion is extremely hateful toward other species and urges violence and warfare. Orc shamans have been noted for their ambition, and many tribes have suffered because of political infighting between warriors and priests.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Orcs have an average lifespan of 40 years. They have a gestation period of 10 months and produce two to three offspring per birth. Infant mortality is high. Orcs are carnivores, but prefer game meats or livestock to demihumans and humanoids.</p>
					<p>It is said that orcs have no natural enemies, but they work hard to make up for this lack. Orc tribes have fearsome names such as Vile Rune, Bloody Head, Broken Bone, Evil Eye, and Dripping Blade.</p>
					<p>Orcs are skilled miners who can spot new and unusual constructions 35% of the time and sloping passages 25% of the time. They are also excellent weaponsmiths.</p>
					<p><b>Orog</b></p>
					<p>Elite orcs, or orogs, are a race of great orcs, possibly mixed with ogre blood. Orogs range between 6 and 61/2 feet tall. They are highly disciplined warriors and have their own standards and banners which they display prominently - it is usually easy to tell when orogs are present among common orcs. Orogs can be found at the vanguard of large orc armies, but rarely on patrol. There is a 10% chance that an orc tribe will have orogs, whose number equals 10% of the male population. (Thus a community of 3,000 male orcs has a 10% chance of having 300 additional orogs.) Small bands of elites (20-80 orogs) will hire themselves out as mercenaries. Orogs have 3 Hit Dice, plate mail (AC 3), and have a +3 Strength bonus on damage dice. For every 20 orogs, there will also be one leader with 4 Hit Dice (THAC0 17). There is but one orog chief, who has 5 Hit Dice (THAC0 15). Orogs use weaponry common to orcs, but will typically possess two weapons apiece.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Half-Orc</b></p>
					<p>Orcs will crossbreed with virtually every humanoid and demihuman species except elves, with whom they cannot. The mongrel offspring of orcs and these other species are known as half-orcs. Orc-goblins, orc-hobgoblins, and orc-humans are the most common. Half-orcs tend to favor the orcish strain heavily, and as such are basically orcs, although 10% of these offspring can pass as ugly humans. They are treated as humans with levels instead of Hit Dice. If multi-classed, they have these maximums: priest, 4th level; fighter, 10th level; thief, 8th level.</p>
					<p>If half-orcs remain single-classed, these maximums increase to: priest, 7th level (Wisdom 15 required for 5th, Wisdom 16 for 6th, Wisdom 17 for 7th); fighter, 17th level (Strength 18/00 required for 11th, Strength 19 for 12th, Strength 20 for 14th, and Strength 21 for 17th); thief, 11th level (Dexterity 15 required for 9th, Dexterity 16 for 10th, and Dexterity 17 for 11th).</p>
					<p>Half-orcs are distrusted by both human and orc cultures because they remind each of the other's racial stock. Half-orcs advance in orc culture by flaunting their superior ability and in human culture by associating with people who don't care about appearance. Most tend toward neutrality with slight lawful and evil tendencies, but lawful good half-orcs are not unknown. Some half-orcs have split from both cultures to form their own societies in remote areas. These half-orcs worship their own gods and (like most hermits) are extremely suspicious of strangers.</p>

					<p>Otyughs (Aw-tee-ug), also known as the gulguthra, are terrifying creatures that lurk in heaps of dung and decay, waiting for something to disturb it. There are two varieties, the regular otyugh, and its larger, more intelligent offshoot, the neo-otyugh. They feed on dung and wastes from other dungeon creatures (gulguthra means 'dung eaters') but also enjoy an occasional snack of fresh meat.</p>
					<p>Otyughs have huge, bloated bodies covered with a rock-like skin that is brownish gray in color, which is in turn covered with dung. They stand on three thick legs that give them slow ground movement but enable them to pivot quickly. They have three eyes on a leaf-like stalk that moves quickly from side to side, enabling them to scan a large area. The eye stalk is also a receiver/transmitter for their telepathic abilities. Otyughs have a huge mouth with very sharp teeth in the center of their mass. They also have two tentacles with leaf-like ridges that they use to smash and grapple their opponents. The tentacles are covered with rough thorn-like projections. Neo-otyughs have smaller mouths than otyughs.</p>
					<p>Otyughs and neo-otyughs speak their own language, much of which is non-verbal (movements of eye stalk and tentacles, or emission of certain smells); they also have limited telepathy that enable them to communicate with other creatures. Otyughs reek of dung and decay.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Otyughs lurk under piles of offal with only their eyes exposed. They usually attack if they feel threatened, or if they are hungry and there is fresh meat nearby. They attack with their two ridged tentacles, which either smash an opponent or grapple it. Grappled opponents suffer <b>2-4 points of damage </b>per round. Otyughs' bite attacks gain a +2 bonus to the attack roll when biting grappled opponents. Otyughs smash grappled opponents to the ground, while the more intelligent neo-otyughs use their victims as shields, bettering their Armor Class by 1. Neo-otyughs may also force attackers to hit the grappled character with a successful attack roll of its own (vs. the grappled character's AC); to do this the neo-otyugh forgoes its squeeze attack. Characters with a Strength of at least 18 can struggle for one round and automatically break free; others must make a successful open doors roll to escape.</p>
					<p>Both types of gulguthra are disease-ridden; their bite is 90% likely to infect the character with a debilitating (80%) or fatal (20%) disease. Otyughs are <b><u>immune to these diseases </u></b>.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>All gulguthra have limited telepathic ability. An otyugh can communicate with creatures up to 40 feet away, while a neo-otyugh can communicate with creatures as distant as 60 feet. Communication is usually limited to simple feelings and emotions such as hunger, temperature conditions and associated discomforts, its dislike of bright lights, and imminent death for its prey. Gulguthra also have infravision with a 90-foot range.</p>
					<p>Otyughs and neo-otyughs live in ruins and dungeons. They make deals with other dungeon denizens, agreeing not to attack them in exchange for their dung and body wastes, which they then devour. To keep the supply of waste coming (and to get fresh meat) they will agree to help defend their home against intruders, which includes many adventurers. Otyughs may be persuaded not to attack creatures in exchange for promises of friendship and food. Neo-otyughs are less trusting (and more vicious), and usually attack intruders on sight. An otyugh's dungeon allies will sometimes ask it to guard treasure for them. Most gulguthra live alone; 10% of the time, during mating season, two gulguthra can found in its lair.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Otyughs and neo-otyughs live underground in heaps of offal and refuse. They hate bright sunlight, preferring the comfortable darkness of dungeons. They mate each year for one month, with one offspring produced. It takes the newborn four months to mature (immature gulguthra have 3-5 HD, damage 1-6/1-6/1-2, and a Strength of 16 is required to break free of their grasp). Otyughs are so disgusting that no alchemist or wizard would want to touch their components, so the corpses of the gulguthra have no known use or value.</p>

					<p>Owls are a family of nocturnal birds of prey. There are many different species and varieties are found in every clime but owls are most common in temperate and subarctic climates. Owls are predators that hunt rodents, small lizards, and insects, attacking humans only when frightened (or magically commanded). Some cultures view owls as symbols of wisdom; others as symbols of imminent death.</p>
					<p>Owls range in size from the pygmy owl, which is 6 inches long, to the great horned owl which is 2 feet long and has a 5-foot wingspread. The owl statistics listed above are for larger species. Most owls are noted for their heart-shaped faces and huge eyes (also notable for a nictitating membrane or inner eyelid). Some owls have swept-back ears that look like horns. Their cries range from gentle hoots to ear-piercing screeches.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Owls have double normal ultravision, quadruple normal hearing, and fly in total silence, so they will surprise their prey more often; others are -6 on their surprise roll. Owls cannot be surprised during hours of dusk and darkness (sunset to sunrise). During daylight hours, their eyesight is worse than that of a human, so owls can be surprised more easliy; they are -3 on their surprise roll if discovered in their daylight resting place. Owls attack with their sharp talons and hooked beak. If they swoop from a height of 50 feet or greater, each attack is +2 and inflicts double damage, but no beak attack is possible.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Owls live in virtually every part of the world. Most owls live in tree hollows, but the burrowing owl lives in holes made by prairie dogs. Owls try to find the lairs of other birds and drive them away. Some daylight birds (crows, ravens) that are preyed upon by owls flock to attack them during the day; because of this, hunters sometimes use owls as decoys. Owls either live in solitude or in pairs. They can be domesticated somewhat if taken young, but cannot be trained to hunt.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Owls prey on rodents, toads, frogs, insects, and daylight birds. No creatures are known to prey on owls other than monsters such as wyverns that will attack most flying creatures.</p>
					<p><b>Giant Owl</b></p>
					<p>Giant owls have their own language. They appear as giant versions of large owl species, with a larger proportionate wingspan. These nocturnal creatures inhabit very wild areas, preying on rodents, large game birds, and rabbits. Like ordinary owls, they attack with their talons and beak. They are too large to gain swoop bonuses but can fly in nearly perfect silence; others are -6 on their surprise roll. Giant owls are intelligent and may be friendly toward humans, though they are naturally suspicious. If encountered in their lair, there is a 20% chance there will be 1-3 eggs (25%) or 1-3 hatchlings (75%) 20-70% grown. The parents will fight anything that threatens their young. Eggs sell for 1,000 silver pieces and hatchlings sell for 2,000 silver pieces on the open market.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Talking Owl</b></p>
					<p>Talking owls are rare and magical creatures indeed. They appear as ordinary owls, but speak common and up to six other languages (DM's option). Talking owls swoop as do ordinary owls. Their primary role is to serve and advise champions of good causes on dangerous quests, which they will willingly do for 1-3 weeks if treated kindly on their first encounter. (A talking owl sometimes feigns a broken wing to see how the party treats it.) Talking owls can detect good. Talking owls have a wisdom score of 21, with appropriate spell immunities ( <i>cause fear </i>, <i>charm person </i>, <i>command </i>, <i>fear </i>, <i>forget </i>, <i>friends </i>, <i>hold person </i>, <i>hypnotism </i>, <i>ray of enfeeblement </i>, and <i>scare </i>).</p>

					<p>Owls are a family of nocturnal birds of prey. There are many different species and varieties are found in every clime but owls are most common in temperate and subarctic climates. Owls are predators that hunt rodents, small lizards, and insects, attacking humans only when frightened (or magically commanded). Some cultures view owls as symbols of wisdom; others as symbols of imminent death.</p>
					<p>Owls range in size from the pygmy owl, which is 6 inches long, to the great horned owl which is 2 feet long and has a 5-foot wingspread. The owl statistics listed above are for larger species. Most owls are noted for their heart-shaped faces and huge eyes (also notable for a nictitating membrane or inner eyelid). Some owls have swept-back ears that look like horns. Their cries range from gentle hoots to ear-piercing screeches.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Owls have double normal ultravision, quadruple normal hearing, and fly in total silence, so they will surprise their prey more often; others are -6 on their surprise roll. Owls cannot be surprised during hours of dusk and darkness (sunset to sunrise). During daylight hours, their eyesight is worse than that of a human, so owls can be surprised more easliy; they are -3 on their surprise roll if discovered in their daylight resting place. Owls attack with their sharp talons and hooked beak. If they swoop from a height of 50 feet or greater, each attack is +2 and inflicts double damage, but no beak attack is possible.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Owls live in virtually every part of the world. Most owls live in tree hollows, but the burrowing owl lives in holes made by prairie dogs. Owls try to find the lairs of other birds and drive them away. Some daylight birds (crows, ravens) that are preyed upon by owls flock to attack them during the day; because of this, hunters sometimes use owls as decoys. Owls either live in solitude or in pairs. They can be domesticated somewhat if taken young, but cannot be trained to hunt.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Owls prey on rodents, toads, frogs, insects, and daylight birds. No creatures are known to prey on owls other than monsters such as wyverns that will attack most flying creatures.</p>
					<p><b>Giant Owl</b></p>
					<p>Giant owls have their own language. They appear as giant versions of large owl species, with a larger proportionate wingspan. These nocturnal creatures inhabit very wild areas, preying on rodents, large game birds, and rabbits. Like ordinary owls, they attack with their talons and beak. They are too large to gain swoop bonuses but can fly in nearly perfect silence; others are -6 on their surprise roll. Giant owls are intelligent and may be friendly toward humans, though they are naturally suspicious. If encountered in their lair, there is a 20% chance there will be 1-3 eggs (25%) or 1-3 hatchlings (75%) 20-70% grown. The parents will fight anything that threatens their young. Eggs sell for 1,000 silver pieces and hatchlings sell for 2,000 silver pieces on the open market.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Talking Owl</b></p>
					<p>Talking owls are rare and magical creatures indeed. They appear as ordinary owls, but speak common and up to six other languages (DM's option). Talking owls swoop as do ordinary owls. Their primary role is to serve and advise champions of good causes on dangerous quests, which they will willingly do for 1-3 weeks if treated kindly on their first encounter. (A talking owl sometimes feigns a broken wing to see how the party treats it.) Talking owls can detect good. Talking owls have a wisdom score of 21, with appropriate spell immunities ( <i>cause fear </i>, <i>charm person </i>, <i>command </i>, <i>fear </i>, <i>forget </i>, <i>friends </i>, <i>hold person </i>, <i>hypnotism </i>, <i>ray of enfeeblement </i>, and <i>scare </i>).</p>

					<p>Owlbears are probably the crossbred creation of a demented wizard; given the lethality of this creation, it is quite likely that the wizard who created them is no longer alive. Owlbears are vicious, ravenous, aggressive, and evil tempered at all times.</p>
					<p>Owlbears are a cross between a giant owl and a bear. They are covered with a thick coat of feathers and fur, brown-black to yellow-brown in color. The 8-foot-tall males, which weigh between 1,300 and 1,500 pounds, are darker colored. The beaks of these creatures are yellow to ivory and their terrifying eyes are red-rimmed. Owlbears speak their own language, which consists of very loud screeches of varying length and pitch.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>The owlbear attacks prey on sight, always fighting to the death (ignore morale rating for purposes of determining retreat). It attacks with its claws and snapping beak. If an owlbear scores a claw hit with a roll of 18 or better, it drags its victim into a hug, subsequently squeezing its opponent for <b>2-16 points of damage </b>per round until either the victim or the owlbear is slain. The owlbear can also use its beak attack on victims caught in its grasp, but cannot use its claws. A single attempt at a bend bars/lift gates roll may be made to break from the grasp of an owlbear. Note that if the Armor Class of a victim is high enough that 18 is insufficient to hit, the hug is not effective and no damage is taken.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Owlbears inhabit the depths of tangled forests in temperate climes, as well as subterranean labyrinths, living in caves or hollow stumps.</p>
					<p>Owlbears live in mated pairs; the male is slightly larger and heavier than the female. If encountered in their lair there is a 25% chance that there will be 1-6 eggs (20%) or young (80%) in addition to the adults. The offspring will be 40% to 70% grown and fight as creatures with three or four Hit Dice, depending on their growth. They have hit points based on their adjusted Hit Dice. Immature offspring inflict 1-4/1-4/ <b>2-8 points of damage </b>with their attacks and a character has a +20% to his bend bars/lift gates roll to escape the hug of an immature owlbear.</p>
					<p>An owlbear pair claims a territory of one or two square miles and will vigorously defend this territory against all intruders.</p>
					<p>An owlbear's main weakness is also its greatest strength - its ferocity. Because owlbears are so bad-tempered, they stop at nothing to kill a target. It is not difficult to trick an owlbear into hurling itself off a cliff or into a trap, provided you can find one.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Owlbears have a lifespan of 20 years. They are warm-blooded mammals, but lay eggs. They prey on anything, from rabbits to bears, to trolls, to snakes and reptiles. Owlbears prefer temperate climates, but some thrive in subarctic environments. As a hybrid of two animals, one diurnal and the other nocturnal, they have an unusual active time, waking at noon, hunting animals active during the day, then hunting nocturnal creatures before going to sleep at midnight. Owlbears are active in the summer months and hibernate during the cold season. There are rumors of white arctic owlbears, a cross between arctic owls and polar bears, but no specimens have ever been captured.</p>
					<p>An owlbear does not actively seek treasure but the remains of victims may be found buried in shallow holes around an owlbear lair. Owlbear eggs are worth 2,000 silver pieces and hatchlings are worth 5,000 silver pieces on the open market. These are typically bought by wizards; while they are impossible to domesticate, they make formidable guardians and wizards sometimes place them in locations of strategic importance (it has been said that an owlbear is a less subtle version of a 'keep out' sign). Owlbears in dungeons and ruins almost always have been placed there by someone.</p>

					<p>Pegasi are magnificent winged steeds that often serve the cause of good. These intelligent creatures are very shy and wild, not easily tamed. They serve only good characters, and when they do, they will serve their master with absolute faithfulness for the rest of his life.</p>
					<p>A pegasus is a thoroughbred which resembles an Arabian horse (though slightly larger) with two large feathered wings. Pegasi are usually white, but brown pegasi are not unknown, and rumors persist of black pegasi. As should be expected, alignments do not vary according to color (all pegasi are chaotic good). Pegasi are 17 hands tall (5 feet at the shoulder) and weigh over 1,500 pounds. Pegasi must be ridden bareback; they will not accept saddles.</p>
					<p>Pegasi speak their own language and can communicate with horses. They can understand common, and will obey their master's commands if they are given in that language.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>A pegasus attacks with its hooves and teeth. It can attack an opponent who is behind it with its rear hooves, inflicting <b>2-12 points of damage </b>, but it cannot use any of its other attacks in that round. A pegasus can also dive at an opponent from heights of 50 feet or higher and use its hoof attacks; each attack roll is +2 and does double damage.</p>
					<p>In battle, a pegasus will try to lure larger opponents (such as dragons) into tight spaces. As the opponent struggles to maneuver into attack range, the pegasus climbs and attacks with its hooves from above. Against creatures their own size, such as griffons, pegasi use their superior speed to outrun them. If griffons are close to a pegasus nest (especially if there are young present), one parent will attack aggressively, get the griffon's attention, and then fly away. By doing this, they hope to lure enemies away from the nest and tire them out over a long distance before returning home.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Pegasi are egg-laying mammals. If encountered in their lair, there will be one nest for every pair of pegasi. There is a 20% chance per nest that there will be 1-2 eggs (30% chance) or young (70%) of 20-50% maturity. Each egg is worth 3,000 silver pieces, while the young are worth 5,000 silver pieces per head on the open market.</p>
					<p>A pegasus can be used as a warhorse; a male can carry weight as a medium warhorse (220/330/440), while a female can carry weight as a light warhorse (170/255/340).</p>
					<p>Pegasi are intelligent creatures. They can <i>detect good </i>and <i>detect evil </i>at will (60 yard range). They use these powers on those who would ride them; they try to throw anyone of non-good alignments who would tame them. If provoked, pegasi will not hesitate to attack creatures whom they perceive as evil.</p>
					<p>To tame a pegasus, a person of good alignment must locate a pegasus herd. Then, at night, he can try to sneak up on a pegasus and surprise it. The character must have the airborne riding proficiency. There is an initial +10 penalty to the roll; pegasi do not like to be tamed. A magical bridle enchanted for the purpose will remove this penalty. If the character successfully makes his roll, then the pegasus will be tamed.</p>
					<p>A tamed pegasus will obey the commands of its master for as long as it lives, if the master remains of good alignment.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Pegasi feed on grass, fruits, and other plants. Griffons and hippogriffs are the natural enemies of a pegasus. Pegasi have a lifespan of about 40 years.</p>
					<p><b>Greater Pegasus</b></p>
					<p>Legend has it that if a medusa is slain and beheaded, there is a small (5%) chance that a greater pegasus will be born, springing fully born from the medusa's cloven neck. These pegasi have the same attacks and movement rate of a normal pegasus but are worth 6 Hit Dice and have 20% magic resistance. They also have a +1 bonus to their morale rating. There is a 5% chance that the leader of a herd of pegasi will be a greater pegasus. Greater pegasi can be tamed only by the noblest and greatest of heroes, and have a lifespan of 100 years.</p>

					<p>Puddings are voracious, puddinglike monsters composed of groups of cell colonies that scavenge and hunt for food. They typically inhabit ruins and dungeons. They have the ability to sense heat and analyze material structure from a distance of up to 90 feet to determine if something is edible. Deadly puddings attack any animals (including humans) or vegetable matter on sight.</p>
					<p>All deadly puddings are <b><u>immune to acid, cold, and poison </u></b>. <i>Lightning bolts </i>and blows from weapons divide them into smaller puddings, each able to attack exactly as the original pudding. Fire causes normal damage, as do magic missiles. Puddings can ooze through cracks that are at least 1 inch wide and can travel on ceilings and walls (falling on victims as a nasty surprise) at the same speed as on a level surface.</p>
					<p>Puddings reproduce by fission. They are adapted to live in a wide variety of climates.</p>
					<p>Puddings starting with 11-30% of maximum possible hit points are 3 feet to 4 feet in diameter; with 31-50% of full hit points, 5 feet wide; with 51-70% of full hit points, 6 feet wide; with 71-90% of full hit points, 7 feet wide; and with 91-100% of full hit points, 8 feet wide. If a pudding is split up so it becomes less than 3 feet wide, it becomes thinner but retains its 3-foot diameter. Because puddings do not use all of their mouth openings (which cover their exposed surfaces), the smallest pudding does the same damage as the largest.</p>
					<p><b>Black Pudding</b></p>
					<p>Black pudding acid is highly corrosive, inflicting <b>3-24 points of damage </b>per round to organic matter and dissolving a 2-inch thickness of wood equal to its diameter in one round. Black puddings also dissolve metal. Chain mail dissolves in one round, plate mail in two; each magical 'plus' increases the time it takes to dissolve the metal by one round (thus plate mail +3 takes two rounds to dissolve for being plate mail, plus three rounds for having a +3 magical bonus, for a total of five rounds).</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>White Pudding</b></p>
					<p>These cold-loving creatures are 50% likely to be mistaken for ice and snow (guaranteeing surprise) even under the best of conditions. White puddings haunt polar regions or icy places in order to find prey, although they can live by devouring any animal or vegetable matter; even ice provides them with enough nutrition to exist. White puddings cannot affect metals but dissolve animal and vegetable materials in a single round, inflicting damage to flesh at an astonishing rate.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Dun Pudding</b></p>
					<p>Adapted to dwell in arid regions, these monsters scavenge barrens and deserts and feed on silicates (sand) if animal and vegetable matter is unavailable. They dissolve leather in a single round, regardless of magical pluses. Metals are eaten at a rate half that of black puddings; chain takes two rounds to dissolve, plate four rounds, with an additional two rounds per magical plus.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Brown Pudding</b></p>
					<p>This type dwells principally in marsh areas. It has a tough skin but its attack is less dangerous than other types of puddings. Brown puddings cannot affect metals but dissolve leather and wood in a single round, regardless of magical pluses.</p>
					<p>Other pudding types are possible, at the DM's option.</p>

					<p>Rakshasas are a race of malevolent spirits encased in flesh that hunt and torment humanity. No one knows where these creatures originate; some say they are the embodiment of nightmares.</p>
					<p>Rakshasas stand 6 to 7 feet tall and weigh between 250 and 300 pounds. They have no uniform appearance but appear as humanoid creatures with the bodily features of various beasts (most commonly tigers and apes). Hands whose palms curve backward, away from the body, seem to be common. Rakshasas of the highest standing sometimes have several heads. All rakshasas wear human clothing of the highest quality.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Rakshasas savor fresh human meat and use illusions to get it. They have a limited form of <i>ESP </i>which allows them to disguise themselves as someone the victim trusts; the rakshasa uses this illusion as a lure and strikes when the victim is most unprepared. The rakshasa must drop the illusion when it attacks. Normally rakshasas can have magical abilities, up to the following limits: four 1st level wizard spells, three 2nd level wizard spells, two 3rd level wizard spells, and three 1st level priest spells. These are cast at 7th level ability. Rakshasas are <b><u>immune to all spells lower than 8th level </u></b>. <b><u>An attacker needs at least a +1 magical weapon to harm a rakshasa; any weapon below +3 inflicts only half damage </u></b>. However, a hit by any blessed crossbow bolt kills a rakshasa instantly.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Rakshasa society is bound by rigid castes. Each rakshasa is born into a particular role in life and cannot advance. Females (known as rakshasi) are fit to be consorts, honored only by their faithfulness and the fighting ability of their children. There are 1-3 females per male.</p>
					<p>Rakshasa society is led by a rajah or maharajah, whose commands are to be obeyed without question.</p>
					<p>Rakshasas wage war on humanity constantly, not only to feed themselves but because they believe that battle is the only way to gain honor. If confronted by humans who recognize their true appearance, they are insufferably arrogant.</p>
					<p>A rakshasa's life varies in cycles of wild self-indulgence in times of prosperity and strict fasting and sacrifice in times of trouble or before battle. They are honorable creatures but will twist the wording of an agreement to suit their purposes. They prefer to deal with humanity by using their illusion powers to deceive and manipulate them, but are brave and forthright in battle.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>As spirits, rakshasas are virtually immortal. They produce a new generation every century to replace the rakshasas that have been slain in battle. No creatures prey on rakshasas except those who would avenge their victims. Rakshasa essence can be an ingredient in a potion of delusion.</p>
					<p><b>Rakshasa Ruhks</b></p>
					<p>About 15% of all rakshasas are greater rakashasas or ruhks, (knights). These warriors are the guardians of a rakshasa community. <b><u>They are hit only by magical </u></b>weapons of <b><u>+2 or better; any weapon below +4 inflicts only half damage against them </u></b>. Their spells are cast at 9th level of ability.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Rakshasa Rajahs</b></p>
					<p>About 15% of all rakshasa ruhks are rakshasa rajahs, or lords. Each rajah is the leader (patriarch) of his local clan. These rulers of rakshasadom have the same abilities as a ruhk, but also have the spell casting abilities of both a 6th level priest and an 8th level wizard, cast at 11th level of ability.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Rakshasa Maharajahs</b></p>
					<p>About 5% of all rakshasa rajahs are rakshasa maharajahs, or dukes. Maharajahs have the same abilities as a ruhk, but have 13+39 Hit Dice, and the spell casting abilities of a 13th level wizard and 9th level priest. A maharajah is the leader of either several small, related clans, or a single powerful clan. Maharajahs reside on the outer planes, where they rule island communities of hundreds of rakshasas, and serve as minions to even greater powers.</p>

					<p>Amid the cinders and soot of the Quasiplane of Ash, amid the choking clouds and wisps of smoke, the rast makes its home. The main body of the creature is fairly small - just big enough to hold its stomach and heart, really. Radiating outward are 10 to 12 spindly limbs (the creatures don't seem to have a standard number), each ending in a barbed claw for tearing apart meat or digging through the soft ash. The limbs don't flap or act in any way like wings, yet somehow the rast flies (perhaps in a manner similar to that of beholders). The rast's head sits atop a flexible neck, its mouth huge and obscenely full of teeth. Narrow red eyes peer out through the dark, sooty air of the plane.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>The piercing gaze of the rast strikes a chord deep within all creatures. <b><u>Those who meet the monster's stare must make a successful saving throw versus paralyzation or freeze in place for 1d6 rounds out of primal fear </u></b>. No creature is <b><u>immune to this effect, and magic resistance offers no protection against it </u></b>. Fortunately, if a basher makes his saving throw, he's safe from the rast's gaze for the rest of the encounter. ('Course, he's subject to the effect again the <i>next </i>time he runs into a rast.)</p>
					<p>Rasts enjoy attacking those held motionless in fear, but they're canny enough to strike first at those <i>not </i>frozen. Once they've put any active foes in the dead-book, they tear into the paralyzed berks.</p>
					<p>Given that rasts have 10 to 12 limbs each, it's no surprise that they usually attack with multiple claws. Fact is, in a single round they can make up to four claw attacks (inflicting <b>1d4 points of damage </b>each), on either one or two foes. This flurry of raking blows often weakens even the toughest of enemies. Yet a rast has one other weapon in its natural arsenal - its savage jaws.</p>
					<p>If a rast elects to bite a foe rather than use its claws, it can make only one attack per round, but that single assault'll cause a lot more pain. The bite of the creature inflicts <b>1d8+3 points of damage </b>, and once it's made a successful hit, the rast continues to grip the victim in its jaws, draining blood from the wound it created. The victim loses blood quite rapidly, suffering <b>1d4+4 points of damage </b>per round. With its strong jaws, nothing can force the rest to release its prey unless it's slain or subdued - or until the victim dies. Physically tearing the rast away from its target always results in the death of the poor sod to whom it's attached.</p>
					<p>As natives of the Quasiplane of Ash, rasts are - in some way or another - creatures of cinder. They breathe ash, even consuming it when they can find no meat (though it won't sustain them for long). And, being <b><u>immune to fire and heat, they cannot burn </u></b>.</p>
					<p>Rasts are canny combatants, using stealth and misdirection to ambush their victims. The Quasiplane of Ash is a harsh place with little prey, so they must be efficient hunters to survive.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Rasts lair within the ash of their home plane, hollowing out small caves to house an entire pack. When not asleep, they fly out and hunt. The pack almost always operates as a unit, instinctively working together. Because prey is scarce, they must spend almost all their time on the hunt. Likewise, they must succeed in bringing down their quarry - a missed opportunity could lead to starvation.</p>
					<p>Rasts of a particular pack never resort to cannibalism, though they will attack and eat members of other packs. Rast pack wars are quick, bloody, and merciless. After all, when one rast kills another, it not only gains food but also eliminates a competitor.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Rast young are born in litters of 10 or more and must immediately fend for themselves as members of the pack. Those that become unable to take on their share of the hunting duties - the old, the sick, the feeble, and so on - are sent away, probably to become food for another hungry rast pack.</p>

					<p>Rats are long-tailed rodents 5-12 inches long. They are aggressive, omnivorous, and adaptable, and they often carry diseases.</p>
					<p>The black rat is about 8 inches long, with a tail at least that long, a lean body, pointed nose, and long ears. The 'black' rat is dark gray with brownish patches, and a gray or white belly. It is a good climber (climb 3) and jumper, but cannot swim.</p>
					<p>The brown rat, also known as the sewer rat or the wharf rat, is 5-10 inches long, and its tail is shorter than the black rat's. Its eyes and ears are also smaller, but it has a larger, fatter body. Brown rats may be gray, white, black, or piebald in color. They cannot climb, but are excellent swimmers (swim 3) and burrowers. If rats infest a building, black rats inhabit the upper floors, and brown rats occupy the lower floor and the cellars.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Rats normally flee anything bigger than themselves, but a trapped rat will do anything to survive and a pack of starving rats will attack anything in order to feed. <b><u>Rats attack with their sharp front teeth and often carry diseases, so that a rat bite has a 5% chance of infecting its victim with a serious disease unless the victim makes a successful saving throw vs. poison </u></b>. Normal rats fear fire, but brave it when very hungry.</p>
					<p>A swarm of rats can be treated as a single monster having an assigned number of Hit Dice and automatically causing damage each round to small creatures in the swarm's area. A typical pack might cover a 10x10-foot area, have 4 HD, and inflict 4 points of damage per round. Weapons have little effect on a pack, but area effect spells and some other attacks (such as flaming oil) are effective. When the pack has lost its hit points, it is considered dispersed and unable to inflict mass damage.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>The chief purpose of rats is to find food. Packs often burrow into and eat food stores. Rats nest almost anywhere, chewing cloth, paper, or wood to make a nest.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Rats are very prolific, breeding three to five times a year. Brown rats produce 2d4+6 young per litter, while a black rat litter contains only 5-6 young. Both types of rats are omnivorous. Brown rats are considered to be more aggressive than black rats. Their teeth are extremely powerful; they have been known to gnaw holes in lead pipes. Rats have a lifespan of two to four years.</p>
					<p><b>Brush Rats</b></p>
					<p>Brush rats (also known as trade rats and pack rats) belong to a much less aggressive family of rats known as wood rats. They are slate gray above and white on their underbellies. They are nearly the size of brown rats. Brush rats build nests or burrows in forested areas. They are attracted to small, shiny objects and sometimes steal them and carry them to their hoard. Pack rats are herbivores and will not attack humans. They do not carry diseases. Brush rats can be trained.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Giant Rats</b></p>
					<p>These vile beasts plague underground areas such as crypts and dungeons. Their burrows honeycomb many graveyards, where they cheat ghouls of their prizes by tunneling to newly interred corpses. Giant rats are brown/black in color with white underbellies, and are related to the brown rat, with fatter bodies and shorter tails. <b><u>As with normal rats, any creature bitten by a giant rat has a 5% chance per wound of catching a debilitating disease; a successful saving throw vs. poison prevents catching the disease </u></b>. Giant rats avoid attacking strong parties unless driven by hunger or commanded by creatures such as vampires and wererats. Giant rats are fearful of fire and flee from it except if driven by hunger or magic. They are excellent swimmers and can attack in water as well as on land.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Osquip</b></p>
					<p>The osquip is a multi-legged rodent the size of a small dog. It is hairless, with a huge head and large teeth. Most have six legs, but some (25%) have eight, and a few (5%) have 10. The creatures' leathery hides are pale yellow in color.</p>
					<p>Osquips build small, carefully hidden tunnels, and their teeth are sharp enough to dig through stone. If someone enters an area in which there are osquip tunnels, the creatures can emerge quickly, and opponents receive a -5 to surprise rolls. The osquip are territorial and attack fearlessly and ferociously.Osquips are not afraid of fire, but are poor swimmers (50% drown, 50% paddle with a movement rate of 1).</p>
					<p>Osquips are difficult to domesticate, but jermlaine and a few wizards have succeeded by giving the creatures gems, for they collect shiny objects. Osquip leather is soft and water-resistant, and their teeth can be used in digging magic.</p>

					<p>Rats are long-tailed rodents 5-12 inches long. They are aggressive, omnivorous, and adaptable, and they often carry diseases.</p>
					<p>The black rat is about 8 inches long, with a tail at least that long, a lean body, pointed nose, and long ears. The 'black' rat is dark gray with brownish patches, and a gray or white belly. It is a good climber (climb 3) and jumper, but cannot swim.</p>
					<p>The brown rat, also known as the sewer rat or the wharf rat, is 5-10 inches long, and its tail is shorter than the black rat's. Its eyes and ears are also smaller, but it has a larger, fatter body. Brown rats may be gray, white, black, or piebald in color. They cannot climb, but are excellent swimmers (swim 3) and burrowers. If rats infest a building, black rats inhabit the upper floors, and brown rats occupy the lower floor and the cellars.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Rats normally flee anything bigger than themselves, but a trapped rat will do anything to survive and a pack of starving rats will attack anything in order to feed. <b><u>Rats attack with their sharp front teeth and often carry diseases, so that a rat bite has a 5% chance of infecting its victim with a serious disease unless the victim makes a successful saving throw vs. poison </u></b>. Normal rats fear fire, but brave it when very hungry.</p>
					<p>A swarm of rats can be treated as a single monster having an assigned number of Hit Dice and automatically causing damage each round to small creatures in the swarm's area. A typical pack might cover a 10x10-foot area, have 4 HD, and inflict 4 points of damage per round. Weapons have little effect on a pack, but area effect spells and some other attacks (such as flaming oil) are effective. When the pack has lost its hit points, it is considered dispersed and unable to inflict mass damage.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>The chief purpose of rats is to find food. Packs often burrow into and eat food stores. Rats nest almost anywhere, chewing cloth, paper, or wood to make a nest.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Rats are very prolific, breeding three to five times a year. Brown rats produce 2d4+6 young per litter, while a black rat litter contains only 5-6 young. Both types of rats are omnivorous. Brown rats are considered to be more aggressive than black rats. Their teeth are extremely powerful; they have been known to gnaw holes in lead pipes. Rats have a lifespan of two to four years.</p>
					<p><b>Brush Rats</b></p>
					<p>Brush rats (also known as trade rats and pack rats) belong to a much less aggressive family of rats known as wood rats. They are slate gray above and white on their underbellies. They are nearly the size of brown rats. Brush rats build nests or burrows in forested areas. They are attracted to small, shiny objects and sometimes steal them and carry them to their hoard. Pack rats are herbivores and will not attack humans. They do not carry diseases. Brush rats can be trained.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Giant Rats</b></p>
					<p>These vile beasts plague underground areas such as crypts and dungeons. Their burrows honeycomb many graveyards, where they cheat ghouls of their prizes by tunneling to newly interred corpses. Giant rats are brown/black in color with white underbellies, and are related to the brown rat, with fatter bodies and shorter tails. <b><u>As with normal rats, any creature bitten by a giant rat has a 5% chance per wound of catching a debilitating disease; a successful saving throw vs. poison prevents catching the disease </u></b>. Giant rats avoid attacking strong parties unless driven by hunger or commanded by creatures such as vampires and wererats. Giant rats are fearful of fire and flee from it except if driven by hunger or magic. They are excellent swimmers and can attack in water as well as on land.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Osquip</b></p>
					<p>The osquip is a multi-legged rodent the size of a small dog. It is hairless, with a huge head and large teeth. Most have six legs, but some (25%) have eight, and a few (5%) have 10. The creatures' leathery hides are pale yellow in color.</p>
					<p>Osquips build small, carefully hidden tunnels, and their teeth are sharp enough to dig through stone. If someone enters an area in which there are osquip tunnels, the creatures can emerge quickly, and opponents receive a -5 to surprise rolls. The osquip are territorial and attack fearlessly and ferociously.Osquips are not afraid of fire, but are poor swimmers (50% drown, 50% paddle with a movement rate of 1).</p>
					<p>Osquips are difficult to domesticate, but jermlaine and a few wizards have succeeded by giving the creatures gems, for they collect shiny objects. Osquip leather is soft and water-resistant, and their teeth can be used in digging magic.</p>

					<p>Ravens and crows are large, black birds known primarily as one of nature's primary scavengers. They are often mistaken as bad omens by superstitious farmers and peasants. In fact, popular mythology supports these views, as many religions speak often of the 'evil black' raven and the 'trickster' crow.</p>
					<p>Ravens and crows have their own limited language. Certain ravens, including some huge and most giant specimens, can speak as many as 100 words of the common tongue and can communicate in meaningful phrases (depending on intelligence, of course). For this and other reasons (like their usefulness as garbage disposals, guardians, and vermin hunters), most ravens and crows make very fine house and yard pets.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Because of the use of scouts within the flock of birds (see below), ravens and crows cannot be surprised during daylight conditions. Ravens and crows attack with both their strong daws and their long, sharp beaks. However, the claws are used mostly for balance and often to obscure the sight of the victim, so only the beak causes actual physical damage. Therefore, ravens and crows employ a grab and peck approach to combat.</p>
					<p>Because of their intelligence, these birds are 10% likely to attack an opponent's eye. In other words, whenever an attack roll indicates a hit, there is a 1 in 10 chance of an eye attack and a resulting loss of that organ.</p>
					<p>Ravens and crows are not adverse to teaming up against a single foe, and the chance of blinding a potential victim increases dramatically as the number of birds attacking increases. Fortunately, the rules for multiple attackers in the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide </i>apply to these creatures as well.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Ravens and crows are found from cold-temperate to tropical climes. All birds of this type travel in flocks. Any that are encountered alone are actually scouts. As soon as any approaching creature that could threaten the flock is seen or detected, the scouts give warning cries, screen themselvs, and maintain a safe distance while keeping track of the creatures and reporting events to the flock by means of raucous calls. In any case, all ravens and crows are fiercely loyal to the few friends they make in a lifetime.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Ravens and crows are principally scavengers, but, being omnivorous, they also raid crops, nests, or unattended caches of food. Tales of giant ravens spiriting off babes from their cribs are more iiely frightening myths than proven fact, but this feat is possible nonetheless.</p>
					<p>All birds of this sort love objects that glitter and shine. Thus they are 25% likely to have several small metal objects, gems, and the like in their nests. In general, the larger the raven (or crow) and the greater the size of the flock, the more valuable and wondrous the small treasures found within.</p>
					<p>In fact, some of these birds have been trained to recover such objects with startling results. More than a few simple bird trainers have acquired enough minor magical rings and precious stones to retire in wealth and comfort. Naturally, the specific training methods employed are closely guarded secrets.</p>
					<p><b>Huge Ravens</b></p>
					<p>Huge ravens tend toward malicious dispositions and are known to serve evil masters when opportunity permits. However, not all raven familiars and consorts are evil, as the alignment of the master is a decisive factor in such arrangements.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Giant Ravens</b></p>
					<p>Giant ravens are both pugnacious and easily raised (if trained from fledglings), and so are often used as guards and messengers. While they are decidedly too small to be used as mounts by all but the smallest of humanoids (i.e., faerie folk and characters under the effects of a <i>potion of diminution </i>), the strength of these powerful birds is enough to carry even an adult halfling on an aerial journey. Fortunately, these journeys are rarely more than dangerous pranks, as giant crows, like their smaller brethren, are not fond of dining on meals that are still wiggling. However, more than a few halflings and gnomes have found themselves high atop a barn or mountain ledge with no safe means of descent (much to the amusement of their comrades).</p>

					<p>Rays, also known as <i>sea bats </i>, are native to warm tropical shallow waters. They are broad, flat creatures, with eyes on the upper, dark-colored surface of their body and the mouth and gills on the lighter underbelly. Their pectoral fins are huge, which gives them a batlike appearance, and they use their short tail as a rudder. They feed on mollusks and crustaceans and only rarely attack humans, with the exception of the malevolent ixitxachitl. These long, flat creatures bury themselves in the silt and sand of the sea floor in order to surprise their prey.</p>
					<p><b>Manta Ray</b></p>
					<p>These huge creatures, which weigh as much as 3,000 pounds, bury themselves in the ocean floor waiting for victims to arrive. The manta has a giant maw (10 to 12 feet across) that can totally engulf any creature man-sized or smaller in a single bite. If the manta's hit roll is 2 or more greater than the number it needed to hit (e.g., rolls a 16 or better when it could hit on a 14), then it has swallowed its prey. Swallowed creatures die at the end of six rounds. Any creature swallowed can attack from inside the ray at -4 with a dagger or a short sword (other weapons require too much space to wield effectively); the ray's Armor Class remains the same. A manta ray can swallow but one man-sized creature or three size S creatures at once.</p>
					<p>If creatures attack its rear, it can use its stinger instead of its bite. <b><u>If it strikes, the victim suffers 2-20 points of damage </u></b><u>and must save versus paralyzation or be stunned for 2-8 rounds </u>.</p>
					<p>The manta ray's stomach may contain treasure.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Pungi Ray</b></p>
					<p>The tropical pungi rays conceal themselves in the sand of the ocean floor with their terrible back spines protruding. Their spines are greenish or brown, resembling plant growth so closely as to be 90% undistinguishable from normal seaweed. Pungi rays are 15 feet across and 6 feet long. Their back spines are in a 3 foot by 4 foot area, with one spine per square foot (12 in total). <b><u>Any creature stepping on a pungi spine must save versus poison or die instantly </u></b>. A footstep on a pungi ray equals one attack; if a creature fell on a pungi ray it would suffer 2-8 spinal attacks. If a pungi ray is attacked it will try to swim away.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Sting Ray</b></p>
					<p>These bottom-feeding creatures are found swimming on the ocean floor in shallow water. <b><u>If any creature steps on one, the ray lashes out with its tail spine, inflicting 1-3 points damage </u></b><u>; any creature struck must also save versus poison or be paralyzes for 5-20 turns, suffering points of damage equal to the number of turns of paralysis </u>.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Ixitxachitl</b></p>
					<p>The ixitxachitl (pronounced icks-it-ZACH-it-ul) are an intelligent race of evil manta rays. They have their own language and worship evil powers. These cruel creatures love to hunt marine humanoids and sacrifice or devour any they catch. Communities of 10 to 100 ixitxachitl live in coral reef mazes with a secret entrance. For every 10, there is one ixitxachitl equal to a 2nd level priest. For every 20, there is one equal to a 3rd level priest. For every 50, there is a 2+2 Hit Dice priest with 5th level ability. If there are more than 50, there will be a leader with 4+4 Hit Dice and 8th level cleric ability and two guards with 3+3 Hit Dice and 6th level ability. Spheres include Charm, Divination, Elemental (water), Healing, Necromantic, Protection, and Sun (darkness only). Guards and leaders have treasure type U that can be used without hands. For every 20 encountered there is a 50% chance that one is a vampiric ixitxachitl (double Hit Dice, drains one energy level per hit, and regenerates 3 hit points per round).</p>

					<p>Remorhaz, sometimes known as <i>polar worms </i>, inhabit only chill arctic wastes. They are very aggressive predators that devour any animal matter, including humans, demihumans, and humanoids; they have even been known to attack frost giants.</p>
					<p>A remorhaz has a segmented body with a winged head and neck, standing on dozens of chitinous legs. Remorhaz have an ice blue color everywhere except on their backs, where a streak of white sets off the many protrusions located there. The size of a remorhaz is determined by its Hit Dice: a 7 Hit Dice remorhaz is 21 feet long, an 8 Hit Dice creature is 24 feet long, etc. Their language consists of roaring, bellowing, and howling.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>In combat the remorhaz beats its small wings, raising up the front quarter of its body. It then snaps itself forward, striking with blinding speed. They are able to swallow prey whole on an unmodified attack roll of 20; any victim swallowed is killed instantly by the intense heat inside the creature. When aroused, the remorhaz secretes a substance that causes its intestines to become very hot and its back protrusions actually glow cherry red from excess heat. Any nonmagical weapon melts from contact with its back and any creature touched by these surfaces suffers <b>10-100 points of damage </b>.</p>
					<p>To determine where a blow has struck a remorhaz, consider where the attacker is in respect to the remorhaz. While the remorhaz is rearing to attack, a blow from the front hits the relatively soft underbelly. When the remorhaz is attacking a creature, any blow inflicted hits the head unless the underside is specifically stated as the object of the attack. In all other cases, the body is the object of the attack, subject to adjudication by the DM.</p>
					<p>Remorhaz are slower than most polar dwellers, so they prefer to burrow into the snow and surface when they hear prey nearby, hoping to achieve surprise. Remorhaz have infravision to 60 feet.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>A remorhaz lair usually consists of a number of large, smoothly rounded tunnels in ice and snow or rock, gradually descending to a large central chamber. Tunnels in ice and snow will be very slippery, as the remorhaz's hot back repeatedly melts the snow, leaving it to refreeze. The central chamber is only about twice the size of a remorhaz, while the central chamber of a nesting pair is about four times their size and may contain icy stalactites.</p>
					<p>Remorhaz have a hunting range of 60 miles. Except where the game has been hunted to extinction, these creatures tolerate the presence of other remorhaz in their hunting grounds.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Remorhaz are carnivores, sustaining themselves with a diet of deer, elk, and even polar bears. They mate in late summer and stay together for two months before departing to live solitary existences. Remorhaz mate every year but can produce offspring only three or four times in a lifetime; the female lays a clutch of one or two grey-blue eggs, remaining with the eggs at all times, coiling around them to keep them warm; if the eggs are left in the freezing cold for only one minute, they will never hatch. Young remorhaz have 1 Hit Die at birth and grow to 7 Hit Dice after four months, when they leave the nest. Immature remorhaz have weaker armor (+2 AC in all locations); 1-3 Hit Dice remorhaz can only bite for <b>2-12 points of damage </b>, while 4-6 Hit Dice creatures inflict <b>3-18 points of damage </b>. From birth, the young remorhaz have all the powers of an adult.</p>
					<p>Remorhaz have lifespans of 30 years. Their eggs are valued at 500 gold pieces and are eagerly sought because these creatures can be trained to be excellent guards. However, a remorhaz can be trained to obey only one or two masters, and will attack its master if hungry enough. The heat secretion of a rhemorhaz, thrym, is valuable as a component for heat-related magical items and can be sold to alchemists for 5-10 gold pieces per flask. The remorhaz will contain 10 flasks worth of thrym per Hit Die.</p>

					<p>Created deep within the experimental labs of Darkhold, the render is without a doubt one of the most savage creatures to ever walk the face of Faerun. The render was created completely by accident, and efforts to duplicate the experiment that brought life to the beast have since met with failure.</p>
					<p>The fearless render is an imposing 9 feet of muscles, sinews, claws, and teeth. The creature has deep black, short fur that covers its entire body and is matted down with a slimy, sweatlike secretion. The teeth of the render are between 5 and 9 inches long, and razor sharp. The beast's claws are equally as long, and are often caked with the remains of its last victim. The most unnerving thing about the render is its glowing amber eyes. They seem to strike fear in its victims only moments before they die. The creature has a deep hatred of all life, and kills without mercy or remorse.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>The render is one of the most savage, feral, deranged creature in the Realms, and likely the most deadly creature in the Heartlands. It is incredibly quick for its size, and imposes a -2 penalty to all surprise rolls when not encountered on open ground. The render has 60-foot infravision. <b><u>In addition, anyone glancing into the creature's amber eyes must make a successful saving throw vs. paralyzation or be rooted in place by incredible fear and unable to act for 13 rounds (or until the fear is dispelled) </u></b>. The render attacks with its two claws and fierce bite, and if all three of the attacks are successful, the victim suffers an additional <b>2d10 points of damage </b>as the beast rends and shreds its prey.</p>
					<p>The render's greatest advantage is its ability to regenerate hit points. The monstrosity regains 4 hit points per round, and double that if the creature is in a berserk fury. The beast's regeneration is similar to that of a troll, and it regenerates even if reduced below -10 hit points. Only electrical damage can permanently kill the render. When it is brought to -10 hit points, over half of the damage done to it must have been electrical for it to be dead and not regenerate.</p>
					<p>The creature's magic resistance is considerable at 30%, and it is <b><u>immune to all poisons, </u></b><b><i><u>charm </u></i></b><b><u>-type enchantments, and </u></b><b><i><u>hold </u></i></b><b><u>spells </u></b>. Normal weapons cannot strike the render. Silver and cold iron weapons have a minimal effect on the creature, inflicting only 1 point of damage per successful strike. Magical weapons do normal damage.</p>
					<p>If the creature is somehow brought to below half of its hit points, it throws itself into a berserk fury, gaining double its normal number of attacks and reducing its Armor Class to -4. <b><u>So brutal are the attacks of the render that if an opponent sustains more than 40 points of damage in one round and is not already dead, the victim must make a successful saving throw vs. death magic or be instantly reduced to 0 hit points - and at the mercy of the creature </u></b>.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>The creation of the render was an accident. The beast is an unholy combination of a summoned tanar'ri and a human prisoner of the Zhentarim. While nefariously allowing the tanar'ri to kill a prisoner for pleasure, a Zhentarim wizard miscast an unknown spell from a scroll. The spell killed the wizard and joined together the tanar'ri and the dying human. The resulting creature killed hundreds of Zhents in Darkhold before escaping into the Far Hills to the south of the citadel, where it has hunted ever since. The render has no memory of its former lives. As far as it is concerned, its existence began in the dungeons of Darkhold.</p>
					<p>The creature is in constant pain from its unholy union. The only way it knows to temporarily relieve this pain is to kill and consume prey - thus the render is a constantly active eating machine. Since the creature fears nothing, it is truly deadly.</p>
					<p>The Zhentarim are desperate to capture the render, but all attempts to do so thus far by Zhentarim wizards and Zhentilar troops have caused twoscore casualties and met with no success.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>The render knows nothing but pain and the need to eat. The beast's stomach can digest anything organic, and it cares nothing about the freshness of its meal. The beast needs to eat a minimum amount of twice per day, though it will eat more frequently for the sheer pleasure of it. The render is presently unique and has no way to perpetuate its species.</p>

					<p>Looking almost too big to be real, rocs are huge birds of prey that dwell in warm mountainous regions and are known for carrying off large animals (cattle, horses, elephants) for food.</p>
					<p>Rocs resemble large eagles, with either dark brown plumage or all golden feathers from head to tail. In a few rare instances, rocs of all red, black or white are sighted, but such sightings are often considered bad omens. These giant birds are 60 feet long from beak to tail feathers, with wingspans as wide as 120 feet.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>The roc swoops down upon prey, seizes it in powerful talons, and carries it off to the roc's lair to be devoured at leisure. The resulting damage is 3d6 per claw. Most of the time (95%), a roc carries off its prey only if both claws hit. If the prey was hit by only one claw, the roc usually lets go, then turns around and attempts another grab. Once the prey has been secured, the roc flies back to its nest. If the creature resists, the roc strikes with its beak, inflicting <b>4d6 points of damage </b>per hit.</p>
					<p>Should a human, humanoid, or demihuman be captured, there is a 65% chance that the victim's arms are both pinned to his sides, making impossible melee weapon attacks or spellcasting that requires hand gestures. A roc will let go of its prey if it suffers damage equal to a quarter of its hit points. A roc can pick up two targets simultaneously if they are within 10 feet of each other.</p>
					<p>A roc usually cruises at a height of about 300 feet, seeking out likely prey with its sharp eyes. When a good target is found, it swoops down silently. The stealth of this first attack imposes a -5 penalty to its opponents' surprise rolls.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Roc lairs are vast nests made of trees, branches, and the like. They inhabit the highest mountains in warm regions. Rocs are not given to nesting close to each other, with a nest rarely being located within 20 miles of another nest. There is a 15% chance of finding 1d4+1 eggs in a roc nest. These eggs sell for 2d6x100 gp to merchants specializing in exotic items. As may be expected, rocs fight to the death to protect these nests and their contents, gaining a +1 bonus to their attack roll.</p>
					<p>The treasure of a roc is usually strewn about and below the nest, for the creature does not value such. It is the residue from its victims. If the roc has been seizing pack horses and mules, some of that treasure may be merchant's wares such as spices, rugs, tapestries, perfume, rich clothing, or jewels.</p>
					<p>The roc ranges for food three times a day; about an hour after sunrise, at noon, and an hour before sunset. If there are young in the nest, a fourth feeding, approximately two hours after noon, is added to keep the young strong and well-fed.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Rocs are occasionally tamed and used by cloud or storm giants. Good-aligned giants do not allow their rocs to attack civilized areas and the animals therein.</p>
					<p>As mentioned before, rocs do not nest too closely together, since such a high concentration of these hungry predators would deprive entire regions of its animal population. Rocs serve to keep down the number of large predators, as they are fond of ankheg, purple worms, and harpies. Thanks to the rocs' prodigious appetites, these creatures are not swarming about with impunity.</p>
					<p>It is said that roc feathers can be used in the manufacture of <i>Quaal's feather tokens </i>, as well as <i>wings </i>and <i>brooms of flying </i>.</p>
					<p>One race that has little love for rocs is dwarves. Dwarven mines located in remote mountains often have to contend with unruly rocs intent on protecting their territory. Attempts by the dwarves to tame rocs have all met with failure, so the accepted manner of dealing with rocs is to kill them and smash their eggs. Adventurers who happen on a community of mountain dwarves may find employment as roc hunters. Such groups would do well not to allow any druids to find this out.</p>

					<p>A roper resembles a rocky outcropping. The creature's hide is yellowish gray and rough, and its body very malleable. They are usually pillar-like in shape, 9 feet tall, about 3 feet in diameter at the base, and about 1 foot in diameter at the top. The roper has a single yellow eye, and a maw ringed with sharp teeth.</p>
					<p>Halfway up its body are small bumps which are the sources of the strands it fires at opponents (see below). Ropers have the same body temperature as their surroundings.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>A roper can stand upright to resemble a stalagmite, lie on the ground to imitate a boulder, or even flatten itself to look like a lump on a cavern floor. They can change color a little, enough to blend into rocky backgrounds. <b>Opponents suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls when faced by a roper.</b></p>
					<p>Ropers attack by shooting strong, sticky strands at opponents. They can shoot a total of six strands, one per round, as far as 50 feet; each strand can extend (1d4+1)x10 feet and pull up to 750 pounds. <b><u>Each time a strand hits (requiring a normal attack roll), the victim must make a successful saving throw vs. poison or lose half its Strength (round fractions down) </u></b>. <i>Strength loss occurs 1d3 round after a hit, is cumulative for multiple hits, and lasts for 2d4 turns.</i></p>
					<p>If a roper's prey cannot break free, it is pulled 10 feet closer per round; when it reaches the roper, the creature bites the victim for <b>5d4 points of damage </b>(automatic hit against a victim held by a strand). A strand can be pulled off or broken by a character who makes a successful open doors roll. A strand can also be cut; it is AC 0, and it must take at least 6 points damage from a single hit of an edged weapon to be severed.</p>
					<p>Ropers are unaffected by lightning and take only half damage from cold-based attacks. <b><u>They have a -4 penalty to saving throws vs. fire </u></b>.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Ropers are not social and rarely cooperate with one another, though a group of them may be found in a good hunting spot. A group of ropers has been named a 'cluster' by scholars with nothing better to do.</p>
					<p>Ropers reproduce asexually by shedding some of their material in the form of a seed. Drawing nutrients from the cavern floor (and perhaps siphoning magical energies from deep within the earth), the infant roper grows to maturity in 2d4 weeks. Until that time has passed, the roper is indistinguishable from a boulder.</p>
					<p>Ropers move using large, cilia-like appendages on their undersides, which also allow them to cling to walls and ceilings. They seldom leave the caverns, but may migrate to a new feeding ground when prey population drops too low in its current home. Migration usually occurs through underground tunnels, but when this is not possible, ropers travel late at night, sometimes giving rise to stories of walking stones.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Ropers eat any meat but prefer demihumans and humans. Gnomes, dwarves, and other mining races often serve as prey for ropers.</p>
					<p>A roper has a gizzard-like organ which often holds undigested treasure. Platinum and gems cannot be digested by a roper, so its gizzard holds 3d6 platinum pieces, and has a 35% chance of holding 5d4 gems.</p>
					<p>The glue from a roper's strands is prized by alchemists, as are its digestive acids, which must be stored in platinum vials.</p>
					<p><b>Storoper</b></p>
					<p>A 'stone-roper' is a roper with a more stony, less flexible exterior; it resembles a statue of a roper. Its rocky tentacles are always extended at least 20 feet, and can shoot to 50 feet to attack prey. The storoper can attack with all its tentacles at the same time, preferring to attack two victims with three tentacles each. Twice per day, the storoper can inject venom through its tentacles. <b><u>Victims must make a successful saving throw vs. poison or be paralyzed for one round, then fight to aid the storoper; the venom lasts for 10 turns </u></b>. Storopers' stony exteriors give them total protection from normal missiles. Storopers have 6 HD, but have all the other abilities and statistics of a 10 HD roper.</p>

					<p>Rust monsters are subterranean creatures with an appetite for all sorts of metals. These unique creatures, though generally inoffensive, are the bane of fighters everywhere.</p>
					<p>The average rust monster measures 5 feet long and 3 feet high at the shoulder. It has a strange tail that appears armor plated and ends in an odd-looking bony projection that resembles a double-ended paddle. Two prehensile antennae are located under the thing's two eyes. The hide of the rust monster is rough, covered with lumpy projections. Coloration varies from a yellowish tan on the underside and legs, to a rust red upper back. Rust monsters smell like wet, oxidized metal.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Rust monsters are placid by nature, but when they get within scent range of metal, they become excited and immediately dash toward the source. Rust monsters can smell metal up to 90 feet away. If the rust monster's antennae touch metal (determined by a successful attack roll), the metal rusts. Magical items have a chance of being unaffected equal to 10% for each plus (a +2 weapon or armor has a 20% chance of not being affected). Any affected metal rusts or corrodes and immediately falls to pieces that are easily eaten and digested by the creature. Metal weapons striking a rust monster are affected just as if the creature's antennae had touched them. Should a nonweapon metallic magical item happen to make contact with a rust monster, treat it as a +2 magical weapon for purposes of determining whether or not it breaks up.</p>
					<p>Rust monsters, being none too bright, stop pursuing a fleeing party for one round to devour metallic items, such as a handful of iron spikes, a mace or a hammer, if the party throws them behind. Rust monsters go after ferrous metals such as iron, steel, and magical steel alloys, such as mithril and adamantite. They choose such metals over valuable metals such as copper, gold, silver, or platinum. In fact, they would continue to pursue a party that just dropped a fistful of copper coins, for example, in hopes of getting the much-preferred ferrous metal of armor and weapons.</p>
					<p>Sometimes (30% chance), a rust monster will even pause for one round during combat in order to eat. Rust monsters are not known for being tacticians, just ravenously hungry metal-eaters. Feeding time always takes one round regardless of the size of the metal meal.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Rust monsters dwell only in dark, subterranean places such as caverns and underground structures. They are not disposed to groups; often a lair comprises one or two rust monsters, with a 5% chance of encountering a single offspring, which acts as a half-strength rust monster with a full-strength appetite. These creatures have been known to range the length and breadth of an underground complex, searching for supplies of metal. Though it will eat raw ore, a rust monster always prefers the refined, forged metal (just as a human would prefer fresh, filtered water over swamp water).</p>
					<p>The creature's relatively inoffensive nature makes it an unlikely target. There have been many accounts of mages approaching a rust monster and the only reaction from the beast was a cursory sniff, then a leisurely departure. Dwarves and gnomes, known for metalworking and mining, have no sympathy for rust monsters, and will do anything to get rid of them.</p>
					<p>The only treasure to be found in a rust monster lair is gems, usually the sort used for decoration on armor or sword pommels. Rust monsters have no grand designs, only the wish to keep well-fed.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Rust monsters help in removing metallic junk and clutter from underground fastnesses. In fact, it is not unusual to find a rust monster and a carrion crawler working in a symbiotic relationship, with the latter eating the organic litter and the former consuming the metal castoffs.</p>

					<p>Sahuagin are a vicious, predatory race of fish-men that live in warm coastal waters. They are highly organized and greatly enjoy raiding shore communities for food and sport.</p>
					<p>Typical sahuagins are blackish green on their backs, shading to green on their bellies, with black fins. Their great, staring eyes are deep, shining black. They have scaly skin, with webbed fingers and toes, and their mouths are filled with sharp fangs. About 1 in 216 sahuagin is a mutation with four usable arms. These specimens are usually black shading to gray. Females are indistinguishable from males, except that they are slightly smaller. Hatchlings are a light green color, but they darken and attain full growth approximately one to two months after hatching.</p>
					<p>Sahuagin speak their own tongue.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Though they wear no armor, their scales are tough and equal to AC 5. Sahuagin wear a harness to carry their personal gear and weapons. A group of these creatures is typically armed as follows:</p>
					<list>
						<li>Heavy crossbow &#38; dagger 20%</li>
						<li>Spear &#38; dagger 30%</li>
						<li>Trident, net &#38; dagger 50%</li>
					</list>
					<p>Spears are used only as thrusting weapons. Nets are set with dozens of hooks that make escape virtually impossible for unarmored victims or creatures not able to grasp and tear with a Strength of 16 or greater. Nets are replaced by three javelins when the band forays onto land. The crossbows fire a maximum of 30 feet underwater and normal ranges on the surface. Tridents have three uses - to spear small prey, to pin prey trapped in nets, and to hold threatening opponents at bay.</p>
					<p>Sahuagin are well-equipped to attack even without weapons, for their webbed hands each end in long, sharp claws that can inflict <b>1-2 points of damage </b>per attack. Their powerful rear legs are likewise taloned, and if they kick an opponent with them, they inflict <b>1d4 points of damage </b>with each hit from either foot. The sharp teeth of the sahuagin cause <b>1d4 points of damage </b>if a bite is scored on a victim. Thus, it is possible for an unarmed sahuagin to attack three or five times in a melee round causing 1-2/1-2/1-4 and an extra 1-4/1-4 if the legs can rake.</p>
					<p>The eyes and ears of these monsters are particularly keen. They can see for 300 feet underwater at depths of up to 100 feet. For each 100 feet of greater depth, their vision is reduced by 10 feet (e.g., when 500 feet deep they can see 260 feet; when 1,000 feet deep they can see 210 feet). Their ears are so sharp as to be able to detect the clinking of metal at one mile, or a boat oar splashing at twice that distance.</p>
					<p>A band of sahuagin is always led by a chieftain. He has one lieutenant for every ten members of the group. The chieftain has 4+4 Hit Dice, and his lieutenants have 3+3 Hit Dice. All are in addition to the normal sahuagin in the group.</p>
					<p>When raiding villages, sahuagin attack en masse, with leaders in the second rank. As long as there is no truly spirited resistance, they continue in their plunder and violence.</p>
					<p>Underwater, in their natural element, the sahuagin are far more confident. Using the three-dimensional aspect of underwater fighting, they sometimes dive down on a group of underwater explorers, coming in from behind, and swooping down and past them, dropping nets on their intended victims.</p>
					<p>When sahuagin attack ships, they swarm up from all sides and try to overwhelm with numbers. They often grab their opponents and hurl them into the sea, where at least a fourth of the raiding party lurks, waiting for such an action or as reinforcements. Some leaders carry a conch shell, which when sounded gives the signal for the group of sahuagin in reserve to enter the fray.</p>
					<p>Sahuagin have an almost paralyzing fear of spellcasters. They direct their strongest attacks toward anyone who uses spells or spell-like powers, such as the functions of some magical items. <b><u>Their saving throws vs. fire-based spells suffer a -2 penalty, and they receive an additional point of damage per die of damage from such attacks </u></b>.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>The sahuagin are sometimes referred to as 'sea devils' or 'devil men of the deep'. They dwell in warm salt waters at depths of 100 to 1,500 feet. Sahuagin are predatory in the extreme, and they pose a threat to all living things because they kill for sport and pleasure as well as for food. They abhor fresh water. They dislike light, and bright light such as that created by a <i>continual light </i>spell is harmful to their eyes.</p>
					<p>The social structure of the sahuagin is based upon rule by a king who holds court in a vast city deep beneath the waves. This overlord's domain is divided into nine provinces, each ruled by a prince. Each prince has 2d10+10 nobles underneath him. Each noble controls the small groups of sahuagin dwelling in his fief. The sahuagin worship a great devil-shark. Sahuagin priests above 5th level are very rare.</p>
					<p>The king is supposed to dwell in a city somewhere at the greatest depth that a sahuagin can exist. This place is supposedly built in an undersea canyon, with palaces and dwellings built along either face. There, fully 5,000 of these monsters live, not counting the king's retinue of queens, concubines, nobles, guards, etc., said to number 1,000 or more. The sahuagin king is reported to be of enormous size (10 Hit Dice + 10 hit points), and of greatest evil. The king is always accompanied by nine noble guards (9+9 Hit Dice) and the evil high priestess of all sahuagin (9+9 Hit Dice) with its retinue of nine underpriestesses (7th-level clerics).</p>
					<p>If sahuagin are encountered in their lair, there are the following additional sahuagin:</p>
					<list>
						<li>1 baron (6+6 Hit Dice)</li>
						<li>Nine guards (3+3 Hit Dice)</li>
						<li>3d4 x 10 females (2 Hit Dice)</li>
						<li>1d4 x 10 hatchlings (1 Hit Die)</li>
						<li>2d4 x 10 eggs</li>
					</list>
					<p>Also, there is a 10% chance per 10 male sahuagin that there is an evil priestess and 1d4 assistant priestesses, for the religious life of these creatures is dominated by the females. If a priestess is with the group in the lair, it is of 1d4+1 level ability, and the lesser clerics are 3rd or 4th level.</p>
					<p>There are always 2d4 sharks in a sahuagin lair. Sahuagin are able to make these monsters obey simple one- or two-word commands. Whenever a sahuagin lair is encountered, there is a 5% chance that it is the stronghold of a prince. The prince has 8+8 Hit Dice plus nine guards of chieftain strength. There are also one 8th-level sahuagin evil high priestess and four 4th-level underpriestesses. The numbers of males, females, hatchlings and eggs in a prince's lair are double the numbers given above. There are 4d6 sharks present at all times.</p>
					<p>Sahuagin lairs are actual villages or towns, constructed of stone. The buildings are domed, and the seaweed and similar marine plants growing around and on these buildings make them hard to detect.</p>
					<p>Few persons have survived capture by the sahuagin, for prisoners are usually quickly tortured and eaten. Any creatures taken alive from raids or intercepting unwelcome visitors are brought to the sahuagins' lair and confined in cells. Although sahuagin are able to stay out of water for up to four hours, there is no air in the confinement areas in the typical village, but in the towns of the nobles there are special quarters to maintain air-breathing creatures. The sahuagin set aside a few prisoners to torture and provide sport - typically a fight to the death between two different creatures in an arena. The bulk of captives are simply killed and eaten. It is seldom that any prisoner escapes, although the sahuagin find sport in allowing captives to think that they have found freedom, only to be encircled by sadistic guards while a school of sharks moves in for the kill.</p>
					<p>The sahuagin are cruel and brutal, and the strongest always bully the weaker. Any injured, disabled, or infirm specimen is slain and eaten by these cannibalistic monsters. Even imperfect hatchlings are dealt with in this fashion. This strict law has developed a strong race, however, and any leader is subject to a challenge. Sahuagin never stop growing, although they grow very slowly, and death comes to most before the years allow growth to large size. Leaders are always the largest and strongest. It is reported that the nine sahuagin princes are each of the four-armed sort, as is the king. In any event, the loser of a challenge is always slain, either during combat or afterward. Sometimes the loser winds up as the main course at the victory feast.</p>
					<p>Duels are fought without weapons, only fang and claw being permitted.</p>
					<p>The sahuagin are chronicled because of their great evil, having time and again raided the land, desolating whole coasts, and destroying passing ships continually. The exact origin of the sahuagin is unknown. It is suggested that they were created from a nation of particularly evil humans by the most powerful lawful evil gods in order to preserve them when the great deluge came upon the earth. Some sages claim that they are degenerate humans who formerly dwelt on the seacoasts, whose evil and depravity was so great that they eventually devolved into fish-folk and sought the darkness of the ocean depths. The tritons, however, are purported to have believe that sahuagin are distantly related to sea elves, claiming that the drow spawned the sahuagin.</p>
					<p>Sahuagin range as far as 50 miles from their lairs. Most of their lairs are located 2d10+20 miles from coastal shores. Some of these creatures enjoy collecting pearls and coral formations, fashioning them into jewelry. This jewelry is worn as a status symbol. They are fond of wealth, which they use as a measure of influence, and for sacrifice to the deities that they worship in exchange for granted powers and other favors. Most of the treasure found in a sahuagin lair belonged to former victims. There is usually a high concentration of water-related items, such as magical boats, tridents, helms, potions, necklaces, etc. These were gained from adventurers who explored underwater too close to the sahuagin community.</p>
					<p>These creatures want nothing less than full control of the sea coasts, collecting as much wealth and power as possible in the process while maintaining the secrecy of their lairs' locations. Those who attempt escape are obsessively hunted down, for fear that the former prisoners may reveal the location of the sahuagins' city.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Sahuagin venture ashore on dark, moonless nights to raid and plunder human coastal towns. They hate even the evil ixitxachitl, and only sharks are befriended by them.</p>
					<p>The feuds and outright warfare between the sahuagin and ixitxachitl have indirectly contributed to preventing the ascendancy of the spellcasting, manta ray-like race. Sahuagin are also fond of eating giant squid and kraken. Their hunting of these monsters of the deep has kept the squid and kraken numbers down to a safe level. Conversely, these beasts enjoy eating sahuagin, which prevents the sahuagin from overrunning coastal areas.</p>
					<p>Of all the sea-dwelling races, tritons, sea elves, dolphins, and hippocampi are the most implacable enemies of the sahuagin. In fact, the few air-breathers that have escaped the sahuagin owe their freedom to such beings that bravely aided the captives.</p>

					<p>Also called <i>fauns </i>, satyrs are a pleasure loving race of half-human, half-goat creatures. They symbolize nature's carefree ways.</p>
					<p>Satyrs have the torso, head, and arms of a man, and the hind legs of a goat. The human head is surmounted by two sharp horns that poke through the satyr's coarse, curly hair. The skin of the upper body ranges from tan to light brown, with rare individuals (1%) with red skin. A satyr's hair is medium, reddish, or dark brown. The horns and hooves are black.</p>
					<p>Satyrs have their own tongue and can speak elven and Common. Satyrs living near centaurs are 80% likely to be friendly with them and speak their language. Rarely (5%), satyrs are found with korred.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Satyrs have keen senses, so they gain a +2 bonus on surprise rolls. They can be almost silent, and can blend with foliage so as to be 90% undetectable; this gives opponents a -2 penalty to surprise rolls. Satyrs have infravision to a distance of 60 feet.</p>
					<p>A satyr attacks by butting with its sharp horns. Some (20%) use +1 magical weapons, especially long or short swords, daggers, or short bows. Before resorting to combat, a satyr often plays a tune on its pipes, an instrument only a satyr can use properly. <b><u>Using these pipes, the satyr can cast </u></b><b><i><u>charm </u></i></b><b><u>, </u></b><b><i><u>sleep </u></i></b><b><u>, or </u></b><b><i><u>cause fear </u></i></b><b><u>, affecting all within 60 feet, unless they make a successful saving throw vs. spell </u></b>.</p>
					<p>Usually, only one satyr per band has pipes. If comely females (Charisma 15+) are in a group met by satyrs, the piping will be to <i>charm </i>. Should the intruders be relatively inoffensive, the piping casts <i>sleep </i>, and the satyrs steal all of the victims' choice food and drink, as well as weapons, valuables, and magical items. If intruders are hostile, the piping is used to <i>cause fear </i>. The effects of the piping lasts 1d6 hours or until dispelled. Any creature that saves vs. piping is not affected by additional music from the same pipes in that encounter. A bard's singing can nullify the pipe's music before it takes effect.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Satyrs are interested only in sport: frolicking, piping, chasing wood nymphs, and other pleasures. They resent intrusions and drive away any creature that offends them. A lucky wanderer may stumble on a woodland celebration, which will contain an equal number of dryads and fauns plus 3d8 other woodland creatures and a 25% chance of 2d6 centaurs. Strangers are welcomed only if they contribute some good food and drink, especially superior (10+ gp per bottle) wines. Such wine can also be used to lure or bribe satyrs. If a group includes elves, they have a better chance of being welcomed.</p>
					<p>These celebrations last all night in warm months, with newcomers waking up the next morning with massive headaches, minus a few valuables, and not a woodland creature (nor their tracks) to be found.</p>
					<p>Shying away from the trappings of an organized society, a colony of satyrs usually includes young numbering 50% of the adults. Satyrs live in comfortable caves and hollow trees. There are no female satyrs and sages believe that dryads are the female counterparts of the satyr, and that satyrs mate with dryads to produce more satyrs and dryads. Satyrs share the dryads' affection for humans of the opposite sex, but a female charmed by a satyr might return after 1d4 weeks (10% chance).</p>
					<p>Satyrs are an inoffensive, fun-loving race. They rarely venture more than 10 miles from their homes, most often doing so to gather food. They are fond of venison and small game but also eat plants and fruits.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Satyrs in sylvan woodlands keep game animal populations at normal levels; they never hunt to excess or despoil plants.</p>

					<p>Shadows are shadowy, undead creatures that drain strength from their victims with their chilling touch.</p>
					<p>Shadows are 90% undetectable in all but the brightest of surroundings ( <i>continual light </i>or equivalent), as they normally appear to be nothing more than their name would suggest. In bright light they can be clearly seen.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>As shadows exist primarily on the Negative Material Plane, they have the ability to drain the life force of their victims. The chilling touch of a shadow inflicts <b>2-5 points of damage </b>to its victim as well as draining one point of Strength. Lost Strength points return 2-8 turns after being touched. If a human or demihuman opponent is reduced to zero Strength or zero hit points by a shadow, the shadow has drained the life force and the opponent becomes a shadow as well. The newly formed shadow is then compelled to join the roving band and pursue a life of evil. Other living creatures simply collapse from fatigue (if taken to zero Strength) or fall unconscious (if taken to zero hit points), where they are left to die or are hounded again upon waking.</p>
					<p>Shadows are <b><u>immune to </u></b><b><i><u>sleep </u></i></b><b><u>, </u></b><b><i><u>charm </u></i></b><b><u>, and </u></b><b><i><u>hold </u></i></b><b><u>spells and are unaffected by cold-based attacks </u></b>. They can be turned by clerics.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Shadows travel in loosely organized packs that freely roam ancient ruins, graveyards, and dungeons. They specialize in terrifying their victims.</p>
					<p>Shadows have no leaders and thus spend much of their time roaming aimlessly about their chosen surroundings. Contrary to popular belief, shadows do not hoard treasure. In fact, such earthly baubles only help to remind the creatures of their former lives. Instead, the furious undead throw all of the treasure they find away, in the same location (often at the bottom of a well or deep pit), where it is out of sight of the band. It is therefore speculated that the removal of a shadow hoard would be quite easy (even welcomed), were it not for the fact that shadows attack living beings without hesitation, regardless of their intent or threat.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>According to most knowledgeable sages, shadows appear to have been magically created, perhaps as part of some ancient curse laid upon some long-dead enemy. The curse affects only humans and demihumans, so it would seem that it affects the soul or spirit. When victims no longer can resist, either through loss of consciousness (hit points) or physical prowess (Strength points), the curse is activated and the majority of the character's essence is shifted to the Negative Material Plane. Only a shadow of their former self remains on the Prime Material Plane, and the transformation always renders the victim both terribly insane and undeniably evil.</p>
					<p>Attempts to remove the curse from captured shadows have all failed, thus providing more clues into the nature of the disorder. A <i>limited wish </i>spell proves only partially successful as the victim returns for an hour but remains insane for the duration. It has been recently speculated that a full <i>wish </i>, followed by a <i>heal </i>spell, might be capable of restoring a shadow to his former state, but again it must be emphasized that this is only a theory.</p>
					<p>Fortunately, shadows rarely leave their lairs, and a bold party wishing to rescue a lost fighter or wizard should have plenty of time to venture forth and recover their friend, provided that no one else explores the lair and slays the unfortunate character while the shadows are absent.</p>
					<p>The original body of a victim is destroyed when changed to a shadow whether by the curse itself or by unprotected exposure to the Negative Material Plane. In any case, killing a shadow is merely a case of severing the bond between the Prime Material and Negative Material forms.</p>

					<p>Shambling mounds, or 'shamblers', appear as heaps of rotting vegetation. They are actually an intelligent form of vegetable life, roughly humanoid shaped, with a height of six to nine feet and a girth of about six feet at their base (legs to waist) and two feet at their summit (the 'head').</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Shambling mounds are fearless attackers and are perhaps the most deadly form of plant life known. Their huge armlike appendages inflict 2-16 points of crushing damage each time they hit, and an unlucky victim hit by both arms in the same round is entangled in the slimy vines and rotting vegetable matter of the creature. Entangled creatures suffocate in slime in 2d4 rounds unless the shambler is killed or the victim breaks free (on a successful bend bars/lift gates roll).</p>
					<p>The shambler's powerful attacks are supported by a combination of defenses that make shambling mounds invulnerable to most normal attacks. The vast amounts of thick vegetation covering the important inner body protect the shambling mound very well, thus its AC of 0. All edged and pointed weapons that strike the shambling mound successfully cause only one-half damage since the blows are greatly weakened as they pass through layer upon layer of cellulose fibers and slime. Since shamblers can collapse themselves at will, crushing weapons inflict no damage at all upon them.</p>
					<p>Fire-based attacks are ineffective against the wet and slimy shambling mounds, and cold-based attacks cause only one-half (if saving throw is failed) or no damage (if saving throw succeeds) to the creature, due to their essentially vegetable nature. Lightning actually causes a shambling mound to grow in size if used against it (add one foot in height, 1 Hit Die, and appropriate hit points for each lightning-based attack it is subjected to).</p>
					<p>Spells that normally affect plants are effective against shambling mounds. Spells such as <i>plant control </i>and <i>charm plant </i>have proven the most successful so far.</p>
					<p>Shambling mounds often lie in shallow bogs waiting for hapless creatures to walk on top of them. The usually surprised beings (-3 penalty to their surprise rolls) are struck and smothered often before they can even call for help.</p>
					<p>Shambling mounds are almost totally silent and invisible in their natural surroundings (-3 penalty to opponents' surprise rolls). They are not above creeping slowly into the camps of unsuspecting travelers at night. They are excellent swimmers as well.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Shambling mounds are only found in regions of dense rainfall and vegetation. Dismal swamps, marshes, and rain forests are their favorite climes, but some wet subterranean places also serve as shambled lairs. They are solitary beasts, only rarely living in the same area as other shamblers - usually only in areas where the food source is constant (e.g., near famous ruins or abandoned gold mines, etc.).</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>The shambling mound is an animate clump of vegetation with a small brain-like control center located deep within the 'chest' cavity. Decapitating a shambling mound, therefore, does not harm it in the least. Since a shambling mound's 'limbs' are merely aggregated clumps of vine and moss, the removal of one or more of them does not hamper the creature either. Remaining vines along the torso will join together to form a new limb by the next round. Only when enough of the shambling mound has been hacked away will the creature die.</p>
					<p>Note that a wounded shambling mound need only retreat to a dense clump of wet foliage to heal. It will rise again in 12 hours, fully healed. It is likely to be very angry as well.</p>
					<p>Since shamblers gain power from electrical attacks, it is suspected that there may exist some shamblers that are vastly larger than the common ones seen thus far. Since will-o-wisps and shamblers often inhabit the same desolate regions of the world, it is possible that shambling mounds of 20 Hit Dice or more lie in the deepest, darkest swamps and jungles.</p>

					<p>Sharks are large, finned, voracious carnivores that inhabit all known oceans and seas. They are perhaps the most aggressive eating machines found in the murky deeps.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Sharks sense pressure changes underwater, most often caused by noises from other creatures. Thrashing about in the water always attracts sharks, since usually only wounded fish behave like that. Sharks can sense these motions from up to a mile away and once one shark discovers prey, more are soon to follow. Sharks also attack mercilessly at the scent of blood, which they can likewise detect at distances of a mile or more.</p>
					<p>When a number of sharks gather around a bleeding victim, the scent of the blood and the thrill of the kill send all sharks into a feedng frenzy. Nothing escapes from such an attack, not even some sharks. Sharks eat anything living, even each other, during a feeding frenzy. Since sharks move up, take a bite of flesh, and retreat very quickly, up to ten normal-sized sharks can attack a man-sized opponent in the water every round.</p>
					<p>Note that the huge megalodons (giant sharks) almost never reach a frenzy, since they are capable of swallowing most creatures whole on an attack roll that is 4 or more above the minimum number to hit. For example, a 15-Hit Die megalodon shark hits an AC 0 creature on an attack roll of 8 or more, but swallows that same creature on an attack roll of 12 or greater. Swallowed creatures suffer 20 points of damage for every round they remain inside the shark. A creature trapped within a megalodon can attack the beast from within, but with a cumulative -1 penalty to damage per round (i.e.. the first round attack has a -1 penalty, the second round attack has a -2 penalty, etc.). The victim must take the shark to 0 points or less before the shark's digestive juices finish their work.</p>
					<p>Since most creaturees are swallowed quickly by a megalodon there is usually not enough blood in the vicinity to precipate a feeding frenzy. On occasion, however, fisherman out hunting for whales and other large water creatures have wounded their prey, only to have a swarm of huge prehistoric-sized megalodon sharks strip it to thebone within seconds. Few fishermen argue the point.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Sharks are pure eating and killing machines, evolving quite naturally into superior predators, and then remaining unchanged for millions of years. They are primarily scavengers, preying on the sick and wounded, but attack fresh meat if tempted to do so. They are very territorial and solitary.</p>
					<p>The only friends the sharks have are the sahuagin, who appreciate the predators for their bloody, ruthless, and efficient natures. They often use sharks as guardians, mounts, sacrifices, and personal pets. The king of all sahuagin is rumored to possess a megalodon shark of largest size, which he apparently feeds quite often. Sahuagin priestesses offer all of their sacrifices to pure white great white sharks of largest size, that are often decorated in collars of gold and silver.</p>
					<p>Sahuagin are the only known race to have successfully trained sharks as mounts and the process is secret. What is known is that a shark and its rider can both attack the same enemy with startling agility, making the combination one of the most fearsome in the deeps. The harness used to mount a sahuagin warrior on the back of a shark is apparently made of a special kind of seaweed, unknown to those of the surface world.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Sharks have only two natural weaknesses. The first one is that their internal organs are only poorly protected by a thick, flexible layer of gristle instead of a hard skeleton. Some creatures, such as dolphins, take advantage of this by ramming sharks from the side. Because of their highly intelligent nature, dolphins are the only true enemies of sharks. They are the only known species that actively hunts down and kills these otherwise greatly feared and respected monsters.</p>
					<p>Sharks are also forced to continuously move through the water in order to force sufficient volumes of oxygen-rich water past their primitive gills. Therefore, a shark that is held immobile for 2-5 hours will die of suffocation. Common spells useful against sharks are <i>hold monster </i>, paralyzation attacks and poisons, and all normal damage causing spells (subject to underwater casting limitations, of course).</p>

					<p>Sharks are large, finned, voracious carnivores that inhabit all known oceans and seas. They are perhaps the most aggressive eating machines found in the murky deeps.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Sharks sense pressure changes underwater, most often caused by noises from other creatures. Thrashing about in the water always attracts sharks, since usually only wounded fish behave like that. Sharks can sense these motions from up to a mile away and once one shark discovers prey, more are soon to follow. Sharks also attack mercilessly at the scent of blood, which they can likewise detect at distances of a mile or more.</p>
					<p>When a number of sharks gather around a bleeding victim, the scent of the blood and the thrill of the kill send all sharks into a feedng frenzy. Nothing escapes from such an attack, not even some sharks. Sharks eat anything living, even each other, during a feeding frenzy. Since sharks move up, take a bite of flesh, and retreat very quickly, up to ten normal-sized sharks can attack a man-sized opponent in the water every round.</p>
					<p>Note that the huge megalodons (giant sharks) almost never reach a frenzy, since they are capable of swallowing most creatures whole on an attack roll that is 4 or more above the minimum number to hit. For example, a 15-Hit Die megalodon shark hits an AC 0 creature on an attack roll of 8 or more, but swallows that same creature on an attack roll of 12 or greater. Swallowed creatures suffer 20 points of damage for every round they remain inside the shark. A creature trapped within a megalodon can attack the beast from within, but with a cumulative -1 penalty to damage per round (i.e.. the first round attack has a -1 penalty, the second round attack has a -2 penalty, etc.). The victim must take the shark to 0 points or less before the shark's digestive juices finish their work.</p>
					<p>Since most creaturees are swallowed quickly by a megalodon there is usually not enough blood in the vicinity to precipate a feeding frenzy. On occasion, however, fisherman out hunting for whales and other large water creatures have wounded their prey, only to have a swarm of huge prehistoric-sized megalodon sharks strip it to thebone within seconds. Few fishermen argue the point.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Sharks are pure eating and killing machines, evolving quite naturally into superior predators, and then remaining unchanged for millions of years. They are primarily scavengers, preying on the sick and wounded, but attack fresh meat if tempted to do so. They are very territorial and solitary.</p>
					<p>The only friends the sharks have are the sahuagin, who appreciate the predators for their bloody, ruthless, and efficient natures. They often use sharks as guardians, mounts, sacrifices, and personal pets. The king of all sahuagin is rumored to possess a megalodon shark of largest size, which he apparently feeds quite often. Sahuagin priestesses offer all of their sacrifices to pure white great white sharks of largest size, that are often decorated in collars of gold and silver.</p>
					<p>Sahuagin are the only known race to have successfully trained sharks as mounts and the process is secret. What is known is that a shark and its rider can both attack the same enemy with startling agility, making the combination one of the most fearsome in the deeps. The harness used to mount a sahuagin warrior on the back of a shark is apparently made of a special kind of seaweed, unknown to those of the surface world.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Sharks have only two natural weaknesses. The first one is that their internal organs are only poorly protected by a thick, flexible layer of gristle instead of a hard skeleton. Some creatures, such as dolphins, take advantage of this by ramming sharks from the side. Because of their highly intelligent nature, dolphins are the only true enemies of sharks. They are the only known species that actively hunts down and kills these otherwise greatly feared and respected monsters.</p>
					<p>Sharks are also forced to continuously move through the water in order to force sufficient volumes of oxygen-rich water past their primitive gills. Therefore, a shark that is held immobile for 2-5 hours will die of suffocation. Common spells useful against sharks are <i>hold monster </i>, paralyzation attacks and poisons, and all normal damage causing spells (subject to underwater casting limitations, of course).</p>

					<p>All skeletons are magically animated undead monsters, created as guardians or warriors by powerful evil wizards and priests.</p>
					<p>Skeletons appear to have no ligaments or musculature which would allow movement. Instead, the bones are magically joined together during the casting of an <i>animate dead </i>spell. Skeletons have no eyes or internal organs.</p>
					<p>Skeletons can be made from the bones of humans and demihumans, animals of human size or smaller, or giant humanoids like bugbears and giants.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Man-sized humanoid skeletons always fight with weapons, usually a rusty sword or spear. Because of their magical nature, they do not fight as well as living beings and inflict only <b>1-6 points of damage </b>when they hit. Animal skeletons almost always bite for <b>1-4 points of damage </b>, unless they would obviously inflict less (i.e., skeletal rats should inflict only 1-2 points, etc.). Monster skeletons, always constructed from humanoid creatures, use giant-sized weapons which inflict the same damage as their living counterparts but without any Strength bonuses.</p>
					<p>Skeletons are <b><u>immune to all </u></b><b><i><u>sleep </u></i></b><b><u>, </u></b><b><i><u>charm </u></i></b><b><u>, and </u></b><b><i><u>hold </u></i></b><b><u>spells </u></b>. Because they are assembled from bones, cold-based attacks also do skeletons no harm. <b><u>The fact that they are mostly empty means that edged or piercing weapons (like swords, daggers, and spears) inflict only half damage when employed against skeletons </u></b>. Blunt weapons, with larger heads designed to break and crush bones, cause normal damage against skeletons. Fire also does normal damage against skeletons. Holy water inflicts <b>2-8 points of damage </b>per vial striking the skeleton.</p>
					<p>Skeletons are <b><u>immune to </u></b><b><i><u>fear </u></i></b><b><u>spells and need never check morale, usually being magically commanded to fight to the death </u></b>. When a skeleton dies, it falls to pieces with loud clunks and rattles.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Skeletons have no social life or interesting habits. They can be found anywhere there is a wizard or priest powerful enough to make them. Note that some neutral priests of deities of the dead or dying often raise whole armies of animated followers in times of trouble. Good clerics can make skeletons only if the dead being has granted permission (either before or after death) and if the cleric's deity has given express permission to do so. Otherwise, violating the eternal rest of any being or animal is something most good deities disapprove of highly.</p>
					<p>Skeletons have almost no minds whatsoever, and can obey only the simplest one- or two-phrase orders from their creators. Skeletons fight in unorganized masses and tend to botch complex orders disastrously. It is not unheard of to find more than one type of skeleton (monsters with animals, animals with humans) working together to protect their master's dungeon or tower.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Unless the skeleton's remains are destroyed or scattered far apart, the skeleton can be created anew with the application of another <i>animate dead </i>spell. Rumors of high-level <i>animate dead </i>spells which create skeletons capable of reforming themselves to continue fighting after being destroyed have not been reliably comfirmed.</p>

					<p>Skum are a race bred by the aboleth from humanoid genetic stock to serve as beasts of burden. Skum do not resemble their ancestors. They have an aboleth-like tail and four extremely strong limbs, each ending in a webbed paw which has two fingers and an opposable thumb. Each digit ends in a retractable claw. A skum's body is covered with a clear, slimy, hairless, gray-green membrane. While they have no external ears, they are not deaf. In the water, they can hear twice as well as a human can in air. A skum's eyes are much like an aboleth's - an eerie shade of purple-red - but are more spherical. Having been bred to function in the dark, skum have 60-foot infravision.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Skum are pure fighting machines and can attack three opponents at a time, though they usually choose to attack a single enemy. Skum males have an effective Strength of 18 and females have 18/50 Strength. Water is their natural element, and when in water they can attack with their bite and all four limbs. On land their bodies are clumsy, so they suffer a -2 penalty on attack rolls and can use only their bite and arms in melee. While in the presence of an aboleth, skum fight until they are victorious, slain, or ordered off by the aboleth. Skum can be trained to use weapons, but only awkwardly; skum fighting with a weapon suffer a -2 penalty to their attack rolls.</p>
					<p>In water a female skum can carry as much as a heavy war horse if the load is strapped to her back; males can carry as much as a medium war horse. On land, a skum can carry as much weight as a human with the same strength.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Skum are the result of at least a millennium of careful breeding. They no longer resemble humanity in body or mind. The aboleth removed what they regard as unnecessary parts: vocal cords, lungs, external ears, hair, etc. The aboleth then added what features they thought would be necessary for their servants, such as the tail for swimming and claws and teeth for fighting. Most skum have low Intelligence (5-7), but some have been bred to be even less bright.</p>
					<p>Skum tend to be as coldly logical as their limited intelligence allows, and they have almost no emotions. They communicate with their aboleth masters and with each other through a limited form of telepathy (range 30 yards) that allows them to understand simple commands. Skum telepathy does not allow communication with races other than skum or aboleth. Their minds are susceptible to mental domination. <b><u>They get no saving throw vs. the aboleth's enslavement power and they save vs </u></b>. all other enchantment/charm spells at -4.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Skum breathe through the skin, but their outer membranes must be moist to do so. A skum out of water can breathe normally for half an hour before drying out and suffering <b>3d4 points of damage </b>each turn.</p>
					<p>A skum female lays one egg at a time after a gestation period of about six months. The egg must incubate on land for four to six weeks, so the female usually buries it in sand. If possible, the parents remain nearby to guard the egg. Once hatched, the baby skum is nursed like a human infant and reaches maturity in three years. Only about 25% of the eggs laid mature into adults. Skum can live to be about 30 years of age, but most die in combat much sooner than that.</p>
					<p>Skum have no natural enemies, but most land dwellers despise them. A skum captured by drow or duergar is in for a long and painful death. Svirfneblin usually take pity on skum captives. Kuo-toa don't hate skim, but no skum servant has ever been observed in a kuo-toa city.</p>
					<p>Skum will eat anything they can catch, and the aboleths are not above letting them scavenge.</p>
					<p>Although the aboleth cannot transform captive humanoids into scum, they can change them so that their offspring will.</p>

					<p>Spectres are powerful undead that haunt the most desolate and deserted of places. They hate all life and light.</p>
					<p>Spectres appear as semitransparent beings and are often mistaken for haunts or ghosts. Unlike most undead, spectres retain the semblance and manner of dress of their former life and can be recognized by old friends or through paintings of the persons they used to be.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Spectres exist primarily on the Negative Material Plane and can therefore be attacked by beings on the Prime Material Plane only with magical weapons. Daylight makes spectres powerless by weakening their ties to the Negative Material Plane.</p>
					<p>The chilling touch of a spectre drains energy from living creatures. A successful attack inflicts <b>1-8 points of damage </b>and drains two life energy levels from the victim. Any being totally drained of life energy by a spectre becomes a full-strength spectre under the control of the spectre which drained him. The victim loses all control of his personality and may become more or less powerful than before, depending on his level and class before becoming a spectre.</p>
					<p>Spectres are <b><u>immune to all </u></b><b><i><u>sleep </u></i></b><b><u>, </u></b><b><i><u>charm </u></i></b><b><u>, </u></b><b><i><u>hold </u></i></b><b><u>, and cold-based spells, as well as poisons and paralyzation attacks </u></b>. Holy water inflicts <b>2-8 points of damage </b>when it strikes a spectre. The water can be splashed on a spectre successfully. <b><u>A </u></b><b><i><u>raise dead </u></i></b><b><u>spell apparently reverses the undead status, destroying the spectre immediately if a saving throw versus spell is failed </u></b>.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Most spectres are solitary, but some enclaves exist where a particularly powerful or lucky spectre has managed to drain mortals of life. This lead spectre is known as the master spectre (always with maximum hit points per die), while the others are known collectively as the followers. In this arrangement, the master spectre almost never engages enemies personally, but instead sends his minions in for the kill. Mortals drained of life by follower spectres are subservient to the master spectre, not the followers. Note that if the master spectre is slain, all followers become independent and can travel anywhere they wish in hopes of becoming master spectres themselves. Once a character becomes a spectre, recovery is nearly impossible, requiring a special quest.</p>
					<p>Spectres hate light and all life, as both remind them of their undead existence. They are therefore encountered only in places of extreme darkness and desolation, like long-abandoned ruins, dungeons, and subterranean sewers.</p>
					<p>Contrary to popular mythology, spectres remain highly intelligent and generally rational after the transformation to undeath. Life makes them lament their unlife, and they bear a strong hatred for all those lucky enough to live and truly die.</p>
					<p>Spectres have enough cunning to plan their attacks, and rival vampires in their skill at remaining hidden from the general populace.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>No one knows who the first spectre was or how it came to be; the few facts detailed above are all that is known with any degree of certainty.</p>

					<p><b>Androsphinx</b></p>
					<p>Androsphinxes are huge, winged mythological creatures with the bodies of male lions and man-like facial features. They can speak the languages of common and all sphinxes.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>The male, or andro-, sphinx is the most powerful of the sphinxes. Its huge paws can kill a normal man with just one swipe. If brute force is not successful, an androsphinx can cast spells as if a 6th-level priest. Note that most androsphinxes use these spells for healing and defense rather than damage and attack.</p>
					<p>The androsphinx has another special weapon as well - his bellowing roar. It can roar three times per day, but must be very angry to do so. <b><u>The first time an angry androsphinx roars, all creatures within 360 yards must roll successful saving throws vs. wands or flee in panic for three turns </u></b>. <b><u>When an already angry androsphinx is continually molested, even after bellowing once, it can roar even louder, causing all creatures within 200 yards to roll successful saving throws vs. petrification or be paralyzed with fright for 1d4 rounds </u></b>. In addition, any creatures within 30 yards of this second roar are automatically deafened for 2d6 rounds (unless they are deaf already or have protected hearing organs). Any creature foolish enough to anger an androsphinx further will unleash his third and final roar with devastating effects. <b><u>All creatures within 240 yards must successfully roll saving throws vs. spell or lose 2d4 points of Strength for 2d4 rounds (use -1 point equals -10% for characters with exceptional Strength) </u></b>. In addition to the weakness effects, any creature within 30 yards of the androsphinx is knocked over unless it is 8 feet tall or larger. <b><u>Creatures knocked over suffer 2d8 points of damage </u></b><u>and must roll a successful saving throw vs. breath weapon to avoid being stunned for 2d6 rounds </u>. The force of this third roar is so powerful that stone within 30 yards cracks under the strain, unless it successfully saves vs. crushing blow.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Androsphinxes are the most solitary of the sphinxes. They shun gynosphinxes because they are jealous of the higher intelligence of their female counterparts, and find their neutral disposition a bit hard to deal with. However, most androsphinxes eventually succumb to the advances of a gynosphinx at least once in their lives.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>What is strangest about androsphinxes is not their combination lion/human appearance (as there are many such cross-mutations found in the world), but their apparent lack of purpose. They are by far the strongest of the sphinxes, but unlike their counterparts, have no true pattern of behavior universal to all androsphinxes. They despise communicating with humans and hate riddles (mostly because gynosphinxes love them so much). It is therefore suggested by those knowledgeable in mythological beasts and desert lore that androsphinxes are the guardians of the sphinxes, evil (hieraco-), neutral (gyno- and crio-), and good (andro-).</p>
					<p>Certainly, androsphinxes are the lifelong adversaries of the hieracosphinxes, but they almost always let the defeated enemy go free instead of finishing the kill (often with a roar or two at the fleeing sphinxes' behinds).</p>
					<p>In short, androsphinxes are free-roaming sphinxes sworn to defend other sphinxes against other races, namely men and their ilk. They have been known to bargain with men on occasion, but are the least greedy of the sphinxes, and are the only sphinxes likely to take offense at such offerings if made by characters with low Charismas or evil alignments.</p>
					<p><b>Criosphinx</b></p>
					<p>Criosphinxes have the bodies of winged lions, but they have the heads of rams. They are always male. They can speak their own dialect of sphinx, as well as that spoken by andro/gynosphinxes and the languages of animals.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Criosphinxes attack with their two paws or with a head butt with their ram's horns. Because they cast no spells and are not the brightest of sphinxes, their bargains with other beings are limited to 'safe passage or die.' They love treasure and lust after gynosphinxes constantly. Plenty of wealth, or knowledge of the location of a gynosphinx's lair, is always enough for adventurers to avoid confrontation with criosphinxes.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Criosphinxes prize wealth and usually seek to extort passers-by for safe passage in exchange for a hefty bribe. They are sometimes found in packs of two or more, but only because all of these sphinxes are looking for the same gynosphinx. They often follow other criosphinxes, even if they have no idea whether or not the leader really knows where he's going. When a number of criosphinxes find a gynosphinx, the first order of business is to restrain their prey. Usually pushing boulders in front of the lair with their huge horns is sufficient. Then the criosphinxes butt horns like rams, except these creatures do their fighting in the air. The winner gets the prize.</p>
					<p>More often than not, however, criosphinxes begin their combat immediately upon finding their quarry, and inevitably the victor strides forth to find the gynosphinx gone. While the criosphinxes often find themselves richer for their trouble, as the gynosphinx rarely sees the need for material wealth while it is fleeing, it is only a poor reward indeed for their often decades-long quest.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Criosphinxes are obviously just further mutations of the already mysterious sphinx form. Their ability to speak with animals seems to be an evolutionary necessity, as criosphinxes are particularly fond of warm wooded areas, often bordering on the desert lands preferred by gynosphinxes.</p>
					<p><b>Gynosphinxes</b></p>
					<p>The gynosphinx is the female counterpart of the androsphinx, having a winged lion's body and human-like facial features. Gynosphinxes are not nearly as powerful as androsphinxes, but they are much more knowledgeable, clever, and wise. Gynosphinxes speak all sphinx languages as well as common.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Gynosphinxes can attack with two paws, but prefer to bargain with their opponents. They help strangers only if they are paid. They accept payment for services rendered or knowledge and advice given, in the form of gems (preferred), jewelry, magic, or knowledge. Knowledge that would be of special interest to a gynosphinx is the location of an androsphinx, but they accept fine prose, poetry, lore, or a good riddle.</p>
					<p>If anyone breaks a bargain with a gynosphinx, he is subject to attack and the gynosphinx won't hesitate to devour the victim if it wins the fight. The gynosphinx can cast the following spells once per day: <i>detect magic </i>, <i>read magic </i>, <i>read languages </i>, <i>detect invisibility </i>, <i>locate object </i>, <i>dispel magic </i>, <i>clairaudience </i>, <i>clairvoyance </i>, <i>remove curse </i>, and <i>legend lore </i>. It can also use each <i>symbol </i>once per week. Note that a gynosphinx is very intelligent and can use these spells in many ways. If a bargaining group of adventurers steps back to discuss their plans among themselves, the gynosphinx will growl a little and cast <i>clairaudience </i>to listen in.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Gynosphinxes are solitary by nature, but not by choice. They spend most of their lives avoiding the advances of criosphinxes (which they detest) and hieracosphinxes (which they fear), and searching high and low for an androsphinx.</p>
					<p>Gynosphinxes are intelligent enough to actively seek out ruins and mystical places, like forgotten temples and such, which they immediately occupy. Using their many spells to learn as much as possible about the setting, they then wait for the next group of travelers, pilgrims, or adventurers to come by and hope that they've encountered an androsphinx in their travels or have spells or magical items that might be usable for just such a purpose.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Gynosphinxes own the dubious distinction of being the only female sphinx. A gynosphinx mated with an androsphinx will produce another androsphinx or gynosphinx (even chances for both). A gynosphinx mated with a criosphinx only produces another male criosphinx, while mating with a hieracosphinx produces similarly displeasing results.</p>
					<p>Fortunately, gynosphinxes are much smarter than all of their counterparts and can avoid otherwise compromising situations through trickery and outright deceit. Unfortunately, they are among the slowest of the sphinxes when flying or running, and the lustful criosphinx and vicious hieracosphinx rarely give up the chase once a gynosphinx has been located.</p>
					<p><b>Hieracosphinxes</b></p>
					<p>Hieracosphinxes are the only evil members of their breed. They have the bodies of lions, but the wings and head of hawks. They are always males. They speak the languages of the other sphinxes, and some (20%) also speak common.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Hieracosphinxes do not cast spells, much like the criosphinxes, but make up for their weaknesses with tenacious evil and viciousness. Their paws and sharp beaks are deadly in combat, and they have been known to swoop down on victims.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Hieracosphinxes live in hilly regions exclusively, dwelling in caves overlooking the nearby deserts. They delight in evil and sometimes gather in bands of as many as six to do their vile business. Most often when a band of hieracosphinxes is encountered, it is hot in pursuit of an androsphinx, which they hate with all of their beings. Only in numbers can they hope to defeat so powerful an adversary, and these sphinxes never believe in honor or playing fair. While it is true that a victorious androsphinx sometimes lets the defeated flee (in the vain hope that the battle may change the losers' dispositions), a defeated androsphinx is always ripped to pieces when the hieracosphinxes are numerous enough and lucky enough to win the fight.</p>
					<p>Hieracosphinxes also spend much of their time searching for a gynosphinx to mate with, but prefer to kill an androsphinx and inhabit his lair until a gynosphinx eventually arrives (usually by following old rumors and legends). It is worthwhile to note that there are more hieracosphinxes than criosphinxes.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Hieracosphinxes are belligerent mutations of unknown origin. It is believed that they were created by elder gods of evil merely to wreak havoc on the other, more pleasant sphinxes described above.</p>

					<p><b>Androsphinx</b></p>

					<p><b>Androsphinx</b></p>
					<p>Androsphinxes are huge, winged mythological creatures with the bodies of male lions and man-like facial features. They can speak the languages of common and all sphinxes.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>The male, or andro-, sphinx is the most powerful of the sphinxes. Its huge paws can kill a normal man with just one swipe. If brute force is not successful, an androsphinx can cast spells as if a 6th-level priest. Note that most androsphinxes use these spells for healing and defense rather than damage and attack.</p>
					<p>The androsphinx has another special weapon as well - his bellowing roar. It can roar three times per day, but must be very angry to do so. <b><u>The first time an angry androsphinx roars, all creatures within 360 yards must roll successful saving throws vs. wands or flee in panic for three turns </u></b>. <b><u>When an already angry androsphinx is continually molested, even after bellowing once, it can roar even louder, causing all creatures within 200 yards to roll successful saving throws vs. petrification or be paralyzed with fright for 1d4 rounds </u></b>. In addition, any creatures within 30 yards of this second roar are automatically deafened for 2d6 rounds (unless they are deaf already or have protected hearing organs). Any creature foolish enough to anger an androsphinx further will unleash his third and final roar with devastating effects. <b><u>All creatures within 240 yards must successfully roll saving throws vs. spell or lose 2d4 points of Strength for 2d4 rounds (use -1 point equals -10% for characters with exceptional Strength) </u></b>. In addition to the weakness effects, any creature within 30 yards of the androsphinx is knocked over unless it is 8 feet tall or larger. <b><u>Creatures knocked over suffer 2d8 points of damage </u></b><u>and must roll a successful saving throw vs. breath weapon to avoid being stunned for 2d6 rounds </u>. The force of this third roar is so powerful that stone within 30 yards cracks under the strain, unless it successfully saves vs. crushing blow.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Androsphinxes are the most solitary of the sphinxes. They shun gynosphinxes because they are jealous of the higher intelligence of their female counterparts, and find their neutral disposition a bit hard to deal with. However, most androsphinxes eventually succumb to the advances of a gynosphinx at least once in their lives.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>What is strangest about androsphinxes is not their combination lion/human appearance (as there are many such cross-mutations found in the world), but their apparent lack of purpose. They are by far the strongest of the sphinxes, but unlike their counterparts, have no true pattern of behavior universal to all androsphinxes. They despise communicating with humans and hate riddles (mostly because gynosphinxes love them so much). It is therefore suggested by those knowledgeable in mythological beasts and desert lore that androsphinxes are the guardians of the sphinxes, evil (hieraco-), neutral (gyno- and crio-), and good (andro-).</p>
					<p>Certainly, androsphinxes are the lifelong adversaries of the hieracosphinxes, but they almost always let the defeated enemy go free instead of finishing the kill (often with a roar or two at the fleeing sphinxes' behinds).</p>
					<p>In short, androsphinxes are free-roaming sphinxes sworn to defend other sphinxes against other races, namely men and their ilk. They have been known to bargain with men on occasion, but are the least greedy of the sphinxes, and are the only sphinxes likely to take offense at such offerings if made by characters with low Charismas or evil alignments.</p>
					<p><b>Criosphinx</b></p>
					<p>Criosphinxes have the bodies of winged lions, but they have the heads of rams. They are always male. They can speak their own dialect of sphinx, as well as that spoken by andro/gynosphinxes and the languages of animals.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Criosphinxes attack with their two paws or with a head butt with their ram's horns. Because they cast no spells and are not the brightest of sphinxes, their bargains with other beings are limited to 'safe passage or die.' They love treasure and lust after gynosphinxes constantly. Plenty of wealth, or knowledge of the location of a gynosphinx's lair, is always enough for adventurers to avoid confrontation with criosphinxes.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Criosphinxes prize wealth and usually seek to extort passers-by for safe passage in exchange for a hefty bribe. They are sometimes found in packs of two or more, but only because all of these sphinxes are looking for the same gynosphinx. They often follow other criosphinxes, even if they have no idea whether or not the leader really knows where he's going. When a number of criosphinxes find a gynosphinx, the first order of business is to restrain their prey. Usually pushing boulders in front of the lair with their huge horns is sufficient. Then the criosphinxes butt horns like rams, except these creatures do their fighting in the air. The winner gets the prize.</p>
					<p>More often than not, however, criosphinxes begin their combat immediately upon finding their quarry, and inevitably the victor strides forth to find the gynosphinx gone. While the criosphinxes often find themselves richer for their trouble, as the gynosphinx rarely sees the need for material wealth while it is fleeing, it is only a poor reward indeed for their often decades-long quest.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Criosphinxes are obviously just further mutations of the already mysterious sphinx form. Their ability to speak with animals seems to be an evolutionary necessity, as criosphinxes are particularly fond of warm wooded areas, often bordering on the desert lands preferred by gynosphinxes.</p>
					<p><b>Gynosphinxes</b></p>
					<p>The gynosphinx is the female counterpart of the androsphinx, having a winged lion's body and human-like facial features. Gynosphinxes are not nearly as powerful as androsphinxes, but they are much more knowledgeable, clever, and wise. Gynosphinxes speak all sphinx languages as well as common.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Gynosphinxes can attack with two paws, but prefer to bargain with their opponents. They help strangers only if they are paid. They accept payment for services rendered or knowledge and advice given, in the form of gems (preferred), jewelry, magic, or knowledge. Knowledge that would be of special interest to a gynosphinx is the location of an androsphinx, but they accept fine prose, poetry, lore, or a good riddle.</p>
					<p>If anyone breaks a bargain with a gynosphinx, he is subject to attack and the gynosphinx won't hesitate to devour the victim if it wins the fight. The gynosphinx can cast the following spells once per day: <i>detect magic </i>, <i>read magic </i>, <i>read languages </i>, <i>detect invisibility </i>, <i>locate object </i>, <i>dispel magic </i>, <i>clairaudience </i>, <i>clairvoyance </i>, <i>remove curse </i>, and <i>legend lore </i>. It can also use each <i>symbol </i>once per week. Note that a gynosphinx is very intelligent and can use these spells in many ways. If a bargaining group of adventurers steps back to discuss their plans among themselves, the gynosphinx will growl a little and cast <i>clairaudience </i>to listen in.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Gynosphinxes are solitary by nature, but not by choice. They spend most of their lives avoiding the advances of criosphinxes (which they detest) and hieracosphinxes (which they fear), and searching high and low for an androsphinx.</p>
					<p>Gynosphinxes are intelligent enough to actively seek out ruins and mystical places, like forgotten temples and such, which they immediately occupy. Using their many spells to learn as much as possible about the setting, they then wait for the next group of travelers, pilgrims, or adventurers to come by and hope that they've encountered an androsphinx in their travels or have spells or magical items that might be usable for just such a purpose.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Gynosphinxes own the dubious distinction of being the only female sphinx. A gynosphinx mated with an androsphinx will produce another androsphinx or gynosphinx (even chances for both). A gynosphinx mated with a criosphinx only produces another male criosphinx, while mating with a hieracosphinx produces similarly displeasing results.</p>
					<p>Fortunately, gynosphinxes are much smarter than all of their counterparts and can avoid otherwise compromising situations through trickery and outright deceit. Unfortunately, they are among the slowest of the sphinxes when flying or running, and the lustful criosphinx and vicious hieracosphinx rarely give up the chase once a gynosphinx has been located.</p>
					<p><b>Hieracosphinxes</b></p>
					<p>Hieracosphinxes are the only evil members of their breed. They have the bodies of lions, but the wings and head of hawks. They are always males. They speak the languages of the other sphinxes, and some (20%) also speak common.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Hieracosphinxes do not cast spells, much like the criosphinxes, but make up for their weaknesses with tenacious evil and viciousness. Their paws and sharp beaks are deadly in combat, and they have been known to swoop down on victims.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Hieracosphinxes live in hilly regions exclusively, dwelling in caves overlooking the nearby deserts. They delight in evil and sometimes gather in bands of as many as six to do their vile business. Most often when a band of hieracosphinxes is encountered, it is hot in pursuit of an androsphinx, which they hate with all of their beings. Only in numbers can they hope to defeat so powerful an adversary, and these sphinxes never believe in honor or playing fair. While it is true that a victorious androsphinx sometimes lets the defeated flee (in the vain hope that the battle may change the losers' dispositions), a defeated androsphinx is always ripped to pieces when the hieracosphinxes are numerous enough and lucky enough to win the fight.</p>
					<p>Hieracosphinxes also spend much of their time searching for a gynosphinx to mate with, but prefer to kill an androsphinx and inhabit his lair until a gynosphinx eventually arrives (usually by following old rumors and legends). It is worthwhile to note that there are more hieracosphinxes than criosphinxes.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Hieracosphinxes are belligerent mutations of unknown origin. It is believed that they were created by elder gods of evil merely to wreak havoc on the other, more pleasant sphinxes described above.</p>

					<p><b>Androsphinx</b></p>
					<p>Androsphinxes are huge, winged mythological creatures with the bodies of male lions and man-like facial features. They can speak the languages of common and all sphinxes.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>The male, or andro-, sphinx is the most powerful of the sphinxes. Its huge paws can kill a normal man with just one swipe. If brute force is not successful, an androsphinx can cast spells as if a 6th-level priest. Note that most androsphinxes use these spells for healing and defense rather than damage and attack.</p>
					<p>The androsphinx has another special weapon as well - his bellowing roar. It can roar three times per day, but must be very angry to do so. <b><u>The first time an angry androsphinx roars, all creatures within 360 yards must roll successful saving throws vs. wands or flee in panic for three turns </u></b>. <b><u>When an already angry androsphinx is continually molested, even after bellowing once, it can roar even louder, causing all creatures within 200 yards to roll successful saving throws vs. petrification or be paralyzed with fright for 1d4 rounds </u></b>. In addition, any creatures within 30 yards of this second roar are automatically deafened for 2d6 rounds (unless they are deaf already or have protected hearing organs). Any creature foolish enough to anger an androsphinx further will unleash his third and final roar with devastating effects. <b><u>All creatures within 240 yards must successfully roll saving throws vs. spell or lose 2d4 points of Strength for 2d4 rounds (use -1 point equals -10% for characters with exceptional Strength) </u></b>. In addition to the weakness effects, any creature within 30 yards of the androsphinx is knocked over unless it is 8 feet tall or larger. <b><u>Creatures knocked over suffer 2d8 points of damage </u></b><u>and must roll a successful saving throw vs. breath weapon to avoid being stunned for 2d6 rounds </u>. The force of this third roar is so powerful that stone within 30 yards cracks under the strain, unless it successfully saves vs. crushing blow.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Androsphinxes are the most solitary of the sphinxes. They shun gynosphinxes because they are jealous of the higher intelligence of their female counterparts, and find their neutral disposition a bit hard to deal with. However, most androsphinxes eventually succumb to the advances of a gynosphinx at least once in their lives.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>What is strangest about androsphinxes is not their combination lion/human appearance (as there are many such cross-mutations found in the world), but their apparent lack of purpose. They are by far the strongest of the sphinxes, but unlike their counterparts, have no true pattern of behavior universal to all androsphinxes. They despise communicating with humans and hate riddles (mostly because gynosphinxes love them so much). It is therefore suggested by those knowledgeable in mythological beasts and desert lore that androsphinxes are the guardians of the sphinxes, evil (hieraco-), neutral (gyno- and crio-), and good (andro-).</p>
					<p>Certainly, androsphinxes are the lifelong adversaries of the hieracosphinxes, but they almost always let the defeated enemy go free instead of finishing the kill (often with a roar or two at the fleeing sphinxes' behinds).</p>
					<p>In short, androsphinxes are free-roaming sphinxes sworn to defend other sphinxes against other races, namely men and their ilk. They have been known to bargain with men on occasion, but are the least greedy of the sphinxes, and are the only sphinxes likely to take offense at such offerings if made by characters with low Charismas or evil alignments.</p>
					<p><b>Criosphinx</b></p>
					<p>Criosphinxes have the bodies of winged lions, but they have the heads of rams. They are always male. They can speak their own dialect of sphinx, as well as that spoken by andro/gynosphinxes and the languages of animals.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Criosphinxes attack with their two paws or with a head butt with their ram's horns. Because they cast no spells and are not the brightest of sphinxes, their bargains with other beings are limited to 'safe passage or die.' They love treasure and lust after gynosphinxes constantly. Plenty of wealth, or knowledge of the location of a gynosphinx's lair, is always enough for adventurers to avoid confrontation with criosphinxes.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Criosphinxes prize wealth and usually seek to extort passers-by for safe passage in exchange for a hefty bribe. They are sometimes found in packs of two or more, but only because all of these sphinxes are looking for the same gynosphinx. They often follow other criosphinxes, even if they have no idea whether or not the leader really knows where he's going. When a number of criosphinxes find a gynosphinx, the first order of business is to restrain their prey. Usually pushing boulders in front of the lair with their huge horns is sufficient. Then the criosphinxes butt horns like rams, except these creatures do their fighting in the air. The winner gets the prize.</p>
					<p>More often than not, however, criosphinxes begin their combat immediately upon finding their quarry, and inevitably the victor strides forth to find the gynosphinx gone. While the criosphinxes often find themselves richer for their trouble, as the gynosphinx rarely sees the need for material wealth while it is fleeing, it is only a poor reward indeed for their often decades-long quest.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Criosphinxes are obviously just further mutations of the already mysterious sphinx form. Their ability to speak with animals seems to be an evolutionary necessity, as criosphinxes are particularly fond of warm wooded areas, often bordering on the desert lands preferred by gynosphinxes.</p>
					<p><b>Gynosphinxes</b></p>
					<p>The gynosphinx is the female counterpart of the androsphinx, having a winged lion's body and human-like facial features. Gynosphinxes are not nearly as powerful as androsphinxes, but they are much more knowledgeable, clever, and wise. Gynosphinxes speak all sphinx languages as well as common.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Gynosphinxes can attack with two paws, but prefer to bargain with their opponents. They help strangers only if they are paid. They accept payment for services rendered or knowledge and advice given, in the form of gems (preferred), jewelry, magic, or knowledge. Knowledge that would be of special interest to a gynosphinx is the location of an androsphinx, but they accept fine prose, poetry, lore, or a good riddle.</p>
					<p>If anyone breaks a bargain with a gynosphinx, he is subject to attack and the gynosphinx won't hesitate to devour the victim if it wins the fight. The gynosphinx can cast the following spells once per day: <i>detect magic </i>, <i>read magic </i>, <i>read languages </i>, <i>detect invisibility </i>, <i>locate object </i>, <i>dispel magic </i>, <i>clairaudience </i>, <i>clairvoyance </i>, <i>remove curse </i>, and <i>legend lore </i>. It can also use each <i>symbol </i>once per week. Note that a gynosphinx is very intelligent and can use these spells in many ways. If a bargaining group of adventurers steps back to discuss their plans among themselves, the gynosphinx will growl a little and cast <i>clairaudience </i>to listen in.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Gynosphinxes are solitary by nature, but not by choice. They spend most of their lives avoiding the advances of criosphinxes (which they detest) and hieracosphinxes (which they fear), and searching high and low for an androsphinx.</p>
					<p>Gynosphinxes are intelligent enough to actively seek out ruins and mystical places, like forgotten temples and such, which they immediately occupy. Using their many spells to learn as much as possible about the setting, they then wait for the next group of travelers, pilgrims, or adventurers to come by and hope that they've encountered an androsphinx in their travels or have spells or magical items that might be usable for just such a purpose.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Gynosphinxes own the dubious distinction of being the only female sphinx. A gynosphinx mated with an androsphinx will produce another androsphinx or gynosphinx (even chances for both). A gynosphinx mated with a criosphinx only produces another male criosphinx, while mating with a hieracosphinx produces similarly displeasing results.</p>
					<p>Fortunately, gynosphinxes are much smarter than all of their counterparts and can avoid otherwise compromising situations through trickery and outright deceit. Unfortunately, they are among the slowest of the sphinxes when flying or running, and the lustful criosphinx and vicious hieracosphinx rarely give up the chase once a gynosphinx has been located.</p>
					<p><b>Hieracosphinxes</b></p>
					<p>Hieracosphinxes are the only evil members of their breed. They have the bodies of lions, but the wings and head of hawks. They are always males. They speak the languages of the other sphinxes, and some (20%) also speak common.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Hieracosphinxes do not cast spells, much like the criosphinxes, but make up for their weaknesses with tenacious evil and viciousness. Their paws and sharp beaks are deadly in combat, and they have been known to swoop down on victims.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Hieracosphinxes live in hilly regions exclusively, dwelling in caves overlooking the nearby deserts. They delight in evil and sometimes gather in bands of as many as six to do their vile business. Most often when a band of hieracosphinxes is encountered, it is hot in pursuit of an androsphinx, which they hate with all of their beings. Only in numbers can they hope to defeat so powerful an adversary, and these sphinxes never believe in honor or playing fair. While it is true that a victorious androsphinx sometimes lets the defeated flee (in the vain hope that the battle may change the losers' dispositions), a defeated androsphinx is always ripped to pieces when the hieracosphinxes are numerous enough and lucky enough to win the fight.</p>
					<p>Hieracosphinxes also spend much of their time searching for a gynosphinx to mate with, but prefer to kill an androsphinx and inhabit his lair until a gynosphinx eventually arrives (usually by following old rumors and legends). It is worthwhile to note that there are more hieracosphinxes than criosphinxes.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Hieracosphinxes are belligerent mutations of unknown origin. It is believed that they were created by elder gods of evil merely to wreak havoc on the other, more pleasant sphinxes described above.</p>

					<p>Spiders are aggressive predators, dwelling both above and below ground. Most listed here are poisonous and bite prey first, because unconscious victims are easier to carry to a lair.</p>
					<p>Spiders have eight legs and eight eyes. They usually fit into two categories: web-spinners, which have bulbous abdomens and thin, sleek legs; and hunting spiders, which have smaller bodies, larger heads and fangs, and hairy bodies and legs.</p>
					<p><b>Hairy Spider</b></p>
					<p>These are the vicious, black, hunting spiders that are found in jungles, tombs, caverns, and throughout the Underdark. Though spin no webs, they can move readily in the webs of other spiders, and they are <b><u>immune to all known spider venoms </u></b>.</p>
					<p>Hairy spiders hunt in groups, swarming over victims to bite. Up to 40 hairy spiders can swarm a human-sized victim, and bite with a +5 bonus to attack rolls once they are attached. Hairy spiders are remarkably <b><u>resistant to crushing damage; rolling or crashing into walls is ineffective at removing or destroying hairy spiders </u></b>. They must be individually struck or torn away.</p>
					<p>Hairy spiders are sometimes used as familiars, especially by drow wizards. They can carry small items and walk on walls and ceilings; they have 60-foot infravision and are not afraid of fire. Some (40%) of these spiders can <i>detect invisibility </i>; they have a 4 in 6 chance, once per round. These familiars are sometimes given treasure by their masters.</p>
					<p><b><u>Victims receive a +2 bonus to saving throws vs. the hairy spiders' weak poison </u></b>. If the saving throw fails, the victim's AC and attack rolls are penalized by 1, and Dexterity is penalized by -3 with respect to Dexterity checks. These effects begin one round after the bite and last for 1d4+1 rounds.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Large Spider</b></p>
					<p>Large spiders are web-spinners that build strong, sticky webs, and often lurk nearby waiting for victims to get stuck while examining the beautiful constructions of their own spinning. A being with Strength 19 or more is unaffected by the webs. For each point of Strength less than 19, it takes one round to break free of the webs (for example, a PC with Strength 15 can break free in four rounds). As many spiders as possible will attack the defenseless victim during its struggle to free itself. Entangled characters can be attacked with a +4 bonus to hit, and lose all Armor Class adjustments due to Dexterity.</p>
					<p>The large spider's poison is Type A, the onset time is 15 minutes. <b><u>Victims take 15 points of damage, or no damage if a saving throw vs. poison (with a +2 to the roll) is successful </u></b>.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Huge Spider</b></p>
					<p>Huge spiders are hunting spiders that prefer to hide in camouflaged tunnels and holes and wait to leap as much as 30 feet through the air at unsuspecting victims. Their opponents suffer a -6 to surprise rolls when attacked in this manner.</p>
					<p>Huge spiders also posses Type A poison, with the same effects as that of a large spider. <b><u>Victims receive a +1 to saving throws vs. the poison of the huge spider </u></b>.</p>
					<p>The watch spider is a specially bred, huge spider used as a guard animal in cellars, warehouses, and some drow homes. It has Low Intelligence (5-7) and can be trained to obey a master, not attack beings designated by the master, and to disable spellcasters. <b><u>Their venom has an onset time of 1-2 rounds and causes paralysis for 2d4 turns, unless the victim makes a successful saving throw vs. poison (with a +1 on the roll) </u></b>. If starved for long periods, they often eat paralyzed prey.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Giant Spider</b></p>
					<p>Most giant spiders are simply much bigger versions of the web-spinning large spiders. Their poison is Type F, which causes immediate death if the victim fails the saving throw.</p>
					<p>The <b>giant water spider </b>is a small version (8-foot diameter, 3+3 HD) of the giant spider. It lives in a burrow in a body of fresh water, and fills its burrow with bubbles of air. These spiders drag prey underwater to their lairs, where they can safely wrap it in cocoons for later repasts. It is faster than a normal giant spider (movement rate 15), but cannot travel through webs. It is only semi-intelligent (2-4) and has treasure as a huge spider; its bite causes only <b>1d4 damage </b>plus poison.</p>
					<p>The <b>flying spider </b>, sometimes just called a hunting spider, is a giant, winged, hunting spider. They are sometimes trained as guard animals, especially by the drow. They are 10 feet in diameter and have 3+3 Hit Dice. Its normal movement rate is 9, and its great gossamer wings allow it to fly at the same rate (MC: D). These spiders can also leap up to 70 feet, and fall any distance without harm upon landing, as long as they use their wings. Hunting spiders have Type A poison, just as a large spider, with the same damage and saving throw adjustment.</p>
					<p>The <b>giant trapdoor spider </b>is a hunting spider which builds tunnels and surprises prey like a huge spider; it is brown or golden, with red strips around its legs. On a successful attack roll, the spider can grab a victim and attempt to drag it into its lair. A victim can get free by making a successful Strength check, with a -2 penalty, or be freed by companions, if their Strength totals 20 or more. The victim can make no attacks.</p>
					<p>A giant trapdoor spider has 4+4 Hit Dice and causes <b>2d4 damage </b>per bite. <b><u>Its poison causes an additional 1d6 points of damage </u></b><u>if the victim fails a saving throw vs. poison </u>. Though it does not build webs, it can travel through webs of other spiders, and it can shoot web strands up to 3 feet. The web strands require normal attack rolls to hit; they cause no damage, but entangle a victim for 1d4 rounds.</p>
					<p>The <b>steeder </b>is a giant hunting spider with tarantula markings, 4+4 Hit Dice, and a movement rate of 12. It does not spin webs and cannot move in them, but its feet exude a sticky substance which allows it to cling to precarious surfaces, even if only one foot is touching the surface. The steeder also uses the secretions (50% of the time) to cling to prey; this requires an attack roll from the steeder, against AC 10 for the victim, adjusted only for magic and Dexterity. A victim can escape by making a successful Strength or Dexterity roll with a -10 penalty. While held, the victim suffers a -2 penalty to attack and damage rolls and is automatically bitten once per round.</p>
					<p>Duergar dwarves use steeders as mounts, fitting the spiders with complex saddles and control straps. A steeder can leap 240 feet, even with a rider. Leaps are considered charging attacks. A steeder moves on walls and ceilings at half its normal rate; duergar saddles are built for this kind of motion.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Phase Spider</b></p>
					<p>Phase spiders are web-spinners with a raised thorax and a human-like head; they are often confused with neogi or driders. They have a unique ability to phase in and out of the Prime material plane. They phase in, attack, and phase out, all in a single round. This gives them a -3 modifier on initiative rolls; if a phase spider wins initiative by more than 4, it attacks and phases out before its opponent has a chance to strike back. Then too, a phase spider usually phases into existence behind its chosen victim, so they get a +4 modifier for attacking from behind. Phase spiders flee to the Ethereal plane when outmatched; there, they gain only a -1 modifier to initiative and can be attacked every round, regardless of the initiative result. Phase spiders have Type F poison, and victims receive a -2 penalty on saving throws against it.</p>

					<p><b>Sword Spider</b></p>
					<p>This giant hunting spider is native to jungles, but has been introduced into the Underdark by drow traders. It has a sleek, hairy, black body with brown stripes. Its legs have bony plates with sharp, raised ridges that cut like sword blades.</p>
					<p>Against formidable prey, a sword spider leaps horizontally as far as 30 feet, and lands legs forward, impaling its prey. Only one attack roll is made for the creature. If the attack is successful, the victim is struck by a number of legs based on its size: size S, three legs; size M, four legs; size L, five legs; size H, six legs; size G, all eight legs. If the spider's leap is greater than 20 feet, each leg receives a +1 bonus to damage. Any upward attack against the leaping spider receives a -4 to the attack roll, due to the impaling blades which protect the spider.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Gargantuan Spider</b></p>
					<p>The gargantuan spider, also called a whisper spider, is a hunting spider with red eyes, a black body, and two gray stripes along its abdomen. They usually live in huge webs in a forest or a cave, keeping treasure from prey in a small hole, or in the bole of a tree. The whisper spider has 8+8 Hit Dice. It can flatten itself to become 80% undetectable; it is so silent that opponents suffer a -5 penalty to surprise rolls.</p>
					<p>Using its webbing, it can make a false spider, a flapping banner, a filmy veil, or any shape it has ever seen; it uses these to mislead prey. The spider can make a web net to trap prey, or it can shoot web strands up to 2 feet to bind a foe. Either attack treats the spider's opponent as AC 10 and prevents the spider from making a melee attack that round. A victim caught by webbing is treated as if caught in a web spell. <b><u>When bitten, a victim must make a successful saving throw vs. poison, with a penalty of -2, or fall into a coma for 2d4 turns </u></b>.</p>
					<p><b>Giant marine spiders </b>are gargantuan spiders with 7+7 Hit Dice, which live in burrows near bodies of saltwater. Like their freshwater cousins, they carry prey to their lairs; though they collect no treasure, their lairs may contain incidental items from victims. They have type F poison, and do not share the whisper spider's special abilities.</p>

					<p>Spiders are aggressive predators, dwelling both above and below ground. Most listed here are poisonous and bite prey first, because unconscious victims are easier to carry to a lair.</p>
					<p>Spiders have eight legs and eight eyes. They usually fit into two categories: web-spinners, which have bulbous abdomens and thin, sleek legs; and hunting spiders, which have smaller bodies, larger heads and fangs, and hairy bodies and legs.</p>
					<p><b>Hairy Spider</b></p>
					<p>These are the vicious, black, hunting spiders that are found in jungles, tombs, caverns, and throughout the Underdark. Though spin no webs, they can move readily in the webs of other spiders, and they are <b><u>immune to all known spider venoms </u></b>.</p>
					<p>Hairy spiders hunt in groups, swarming over victims to bite. Up to 40 hairy spiders can swarm a human-sized victim, and bite with a +5 bonus to attack rolls once they are attached. Hairy spiders are remarkably <b><u>resistant to crushing damage; rolling or crashing into walls is ineffective at removing or destroying hairy spiders </u></b>. They must be individually struck or torn away.</p>
					<p>Hairy spiders are sometimes used as familiars, especially by drow wizards. They can carry small items and walk on walls and ceilings; they have 60-foot infravision and are not afraid of fire. Some (40%) of these spiders can <i>detect invisibility </i>; they have a 4 in 6 chance, once per round. These familiars are sometimes given treasure by their masters.</p>
					<p><b><u>Victims receive a +2 bonus to saving throws vs. the hairy spiders' weak poison </u></b>. If the saving throw fails, the victim's AC and attack rolls are penalized by 1, and Dexterity is penalized by -3 with respect to Dexterity checks. These effects begin one round after the bite and last for 1d4+1 rounds.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Large Spider</b></p>
					<p>Large spiders are web-spinners that build strong, sticky webs, and often lurk nearby waiting for victims to get stuck while examining the beautiful constructions of their own spinning. A being with Strength 19 or more is unaffected by the webs. For each point of Strength less than 19, it takes one round to break free of the webs (for example, a PC with Strength 15 can break free in four rounds). As many spiders as possible will attack the defenseless victim during its struggle to free itself. Entangled characters can be attacked with a +4 bonus to hit, and lose all Armor Class adjustments due to Dexterity.</p>
					<p>The large spider's poison is Type A, the onset time is 15 minutes. <b><u>Victims take 15 points of damage, or no damage if a saving throw vs. poison (with a +2 to the roll) is successful </u></b>.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Huge Spider</b></p>
					<p>Huge spiders are hunting spiders that prefer to hide in camouflaged tunnels and holes and wait to leap as much as 30 feet through the air at unsuspecting victims. Their opponents suffer a -6 to surprise rolls when attacked in this manner.</p>
					<p>Huge spiders also posses Type A poison, with the same effects as that of a large spider. <b><u>Victims receive a +1 to saving throws vs. the poison of the huge spider </u></b>.</p>
					<p>The watch spider is a specially bred, huge spider used as a guard animal in cellars, warehouses, and some drow homes. It has Low Intelligence (5-7) and can be trained to obey a master, not attack beings designated by the master, and to disable spellcasters. <b><u>Their venom has an onset time of 1-2 rounds and causes paralysis for 2d4 turns, unless the victim makes a successful saving throw vs. poison (with a +1 on the roll) </u></b>. If starved for long periods, they often eat paralyzed prey.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Giant Spider</b></p>
					<p>Most giant spiders are simply much bigger versions of the web-spinning large spiders. Their poison is Type F, which causes immediate death if the victim fails the saving throw.</p>
					<p>The <b>giant water spider </b>is a small version (8-foot diameter, 3+3 HD) of the giant spider. It lives in a burrow in a body of fresh water, and fills its burrow with bubbles of air. These spiders drag prey underwater to their lairs, where they can safely wrap it in cocoons for later repasts. It is faster than a normal giant spider (movement rate 15), but cannot travel through webs. It is only semi-intelligent (2-4) and has treasure as a huge spider; its bite causes only <b>1d4 damage </b>plus poison.</p>
					<p>The <b>flying spider </b>, sometimes just called a hunting spider, is a giant, winged, hunting spider. They are sometimes trained as guard animals, especially by the drow. They are 10 feet in diameter and have 3+3 Hit Dice. Its normal movement rate is 9, and its great gossamer wings allow it to fly at the same rate (MC: D). These spiders can also leap up to 70 feet, and fall any distance without harm upon landing, as long as they use their wings. Hunting spiders have Type A poison, just as a large spider, with the same damage and saving throw adjustment.</p>
					<p>The <b>giant trapdoor spider </b>is a hunting spider which builds tunnels and surprises prey like a huge spider; it is brown or golden, with red strips around its legs. On a successful attack roll, the spider can grab a victim and attempt to drag it into its lair. A victim can get free by making a successful Strength check, with a -2 penalty, or be freed by companions, if their Strength totals 20 or more. The victim can make no attacks.</p>
					<p>A giant trapdoor spider has 4+4 Hit Dice and causes <b>2d4 damage </b>per bite. <b><u>Its poison causes an additional 1d6 points of damage </u></b><u>if the victim fails a saving throw vs. poison </u>. Though it does not build webs, it can travel through webs of other spiders, and it can shoot web strands up to 3 feet. The web strands require normal attack rolls to hit; they cause no damage, but entangle a victim for 1d4 rounds.</p>
					<p>The <b>steeder </b>is a giant hunting spider with tarantula markings, 4+4 Hit Dice, and a movement rate of 12. It does not spin webs and cannot move in them, but its feet exude a sticky substance which allows it to cling to precarious surfaces, even if only one foot is touching the surface. The steeder also uses the secretions (50% of the time) to cling to prey; this requires an attack roll from the steeder, against AC 10 for the victim, adjusted only for magic and Dexterity. A victim can escape by making a successful Strength or Dexterity roll with a -10 penalty. While held, the victim suffers a -2 penalty to attack and damage rolls and is automatically bitten once per round.</p>
					<p>Duergar dwarves use steeders as mounts, fitting the spiders with complex saddles and control straps. A steeder can leap 240 feet, even with a rider. Leaps are considered charging attacks. A steeder moves on walls and ceilings at half its normal rate; duergar saddles are built for this kind of motion.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Phase Spider</b></p>
					<p>Phase spiders are web-spinners with a raised thorax and a human-like head; they are often confused with neogi or driders. They have a unique ability to phase in and out of the Prime material plane. They phase in, attack, and phase out, all in a single round. This gives them a -3 modifier on initiative rolls; if a phase spider wins initiative by more than 4, it attacks and phases out before its opponent has a chance to strike back. Then too, a phase spider usually phases into existence behind its chosen victim, so they get a +4 modifier for attacking from behind. Phase spiders flee to the Ethereal plane when outmatched; there, they gain only a -1 modifier to initiative and can be attacked every round, regardless of the initiative result. Phase spiders have Type F poison, and victims receive a -2 penalty on saving throws against it.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Sword Spider</b></p>
					<p>This giant hunting spider is native to jungles, but has been introduced into the Underdark by drow traders. It has a sleek, hairy, black body with brown stripes. Its legs have bony plates with sharp, raised ridges that cut like sword blades.</p>
					<p>Against formidable prey, a sword spider leaps horizontally as far as 30 feet, and lands legs forward, impaling its prey. Only one attack roll is made for the creature. If the attack is successful, the victim is struck by a number of legs based on its size: size S, three legs; size M, four legs; size L, five legs; size H, six legs; size G, all eight legs. If the spider's leap is greater than 20 feet, each leg receives a +1 bonus to damage. Any upward attack against the leaping spider receives a -4 to the attack roll, due to the impaling blades which protect the spider.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Gargantuan Spider</b></p>
					<p>The gargantuan spider, also called a whisper spider, is a hunting spider with red eyes, a black body, and two gray stripes along its abdomen. They usually live in huge webs in a forest or a cave, keeping treasure from prey in a small hole, or in the bole of a tree. The whisper spider has 8+8 Hit Dice. It can flatten itself to become 80% undetectable; it is so silent that opponents suffer a -5 penalty to surprise rolls.</p>
					<p>Using its webbing, it can make a false spider, a flapping banner, a filmy veil, or any shape it has ever seen; it uses these to mislead prey. The spider can make a web net to trap prey, or it can shoot web strands up to 2 feet to bind a foe. Either attack treats the spider's opponent as AC 10 and prevents the spider from making a melee attack that round. A victim caught by webbing is treated as if caught in a web spell. <b><u>When bitten, a victim must make a successful saving throw vs. poison, with a penalty of -2, or fall into a coma for 2d4 turns </u></b>.</p>
					<p><b>Giant marine spiders </b>are gargantuan spiders with 7+7 Hit Dice, which live in burrows near bodies of saltwater. Like their freshwater cousins, they carry prey to their lairs; though they collect no treasure, their lairs may contain incidental items from victims. They have type F poison, and do not share the whisper spider's special abilities.</p>

					<p>Spiders are aggressive predators, dwelling both above and below ground. Most listed here are poisonous and bite prey first, because unconscious victims are easier to carry to a lair.</p>
					<p>Spiders have eight legs and eight eyes. They usually fit into two categories: web-spinners, which have bulbous abdomens and thin, sleek legs; and hunting spiders, which have smaller bodies, larger heads and fangs, and hairy bodies and legs.</p>
					<p><b>Hairy Spider</b></p>
					<p>These are the vicious, black, hunting spiders that are found in jungles, tombs, caverns, and throughout the Underdark. Though spin no webs, they can move readily in the webs of other spiders, and they are <b><u>immune to all known spider venoms </u></b>.</p>
					<p>Hairy spiders hunt in groups, swarming over victims to bite. Up to 40 hairy spiders can swarm a human-sized victim, and bite with a +5 bonus to attack rolls once they are attached. Hairy spiders are remarkably <b><u>resistant to crushing damage; rolling or crashing into walls is ineffective at removing or destroying hairy spiders </u></b>. They must be individually struck or torn away.</p>
					<p>Hairy spiders are sometimes used as familiars, especially by drow wizards. They can carry small items and walk on walls and ceilings; they have 60-foot infravision and are not afraid of fire. Some (40%) of these spiders can <i>detect invisibility </i>; they have a 4 in 6 chance, once per round. These familiars are sometimes given treasure by their masters.</p>
					<p><b><u>Victims receive a +2 bonus to saving throws vs. the hairy spiders' weak poison </u></b>. If the saving throw fails, the victim's AC and attack rolls are penalized by 1, and Dexterity is penalized by -3 with respect to Dexterity checks. These effects begin one round after the bite and last for 1d4+1 rounds.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Large Spider</b></p>
					<p>Large spiders are web-spinners that build strong, sticky webs, and often lurk nearby waiting for victims to get stuck while examining the beautiful constructions of their own spinning. A being with Strength 19 or more is unaffected by the webs. For each point of Strength less than 19, it takes one round to break free of the webs (for example, a PC with Strength 15 can break free in four rounds). As many spiders as possible will attack the defenseless victim during its struggle to free itself. Entangled characters can be attacked with a +4 bonus to hit, and lose all Armor Class adjustments due to Dexterity.</p>
					<p>The large spider's poison is Type A, the onset time is 15 minutes. <b><u>Victims take 15 points of damage, or no damage if a saving throw vs. poison (with a +2 to the roll) is successful </u></b>.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Huge Spider</b></p>
					<p>Huge spiders are hunting spiders that prefer to hide in camouflaged tunnels and holes and wait to leap as much as 30 feet through the air at unsuspecting victims. Their opponents suffer a -6 to surprise rolls when attacked in this manner.</p>
					<p>Huge spiders also posses Type A poison, with the same effects as that of a large spider. <b><u>Victims receive a +1 to saving throws vs. the poison of the huge spider </u></b>.</p>
					<p>The watch spider is a specially bred, huge spider used as a guard animal in cellars, warehouses, and some drow homes. It has Low Intelligence (5-7) and can be trained to obey a master, not attack beings designated by the master, and to disable spellcasters. <b><u>Their venom has an onset time of 1-2 rounds and causes paralysis for 2d4 turns, unless the victim makes a successful saving throw vs. poison (with a +1 on the roll) </u></b>. If starved for long periods, they often eat paralyzed prey.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Giant Spider</b></p>
					<p>Most giant spiders are simply much bigger versions of the web-spinning large spiders. Their poison is Type F, which causes immediate death if the victim fails the saving throw.</p>
					<p>The <b>giant water spider </b>is a small version (8-foot diameter, 3+3 HD) of the giant spider. It lives in a burrow in a body of fresh water, and fills its burrow with bubbles of air. These spiders drag prey underwater to their lairs, where they can safely wrap it in cocoons for later repasts. It is faster than a normal giant spider (movement rate 15), but cannot travel through webs. It is only semi-intelligent (2-4) and has treasure as a huge spider; its bite causes only <b>1d4 damage </b>plus poison.</p>
					<p>The <b>flying spider </b>, sometimes just called a hunting spider, is a giant, winged, hunting spider. They are sometimes trained as guard animals, especially by the drow. They are 10 feet in diameter and have 3+3 Hit Dice. Its normal movement rate is 9, and its great gossamer wings allow it to fly at the same rate (MC: D). These spiders can also leap up to 70 feet, and fall any distance without harm upon landing, as long as they use their wings. Hunting spiders have Type A poison, just as a large spider, with the same damage and saving throw adjustment.</p>
					<p>The <b>giant trapdoor spider </b>is a hunting spider which builds tunnels and surprises prey like a huge spider; it is brown or golden, with red strips around its legs. On a successful attack roll, the spider can grab a victim and attempt to drag it into its lair. A victim can get free by making a successful Strength check, with a -2 penalty, or be freed by companions, if their Strength totals 20 or more. The victim can make no attacks.</p>
					<p>A giant trapdoor spider has 4+4 Hit Dice and causes <b>2d4 damage </b>per bite. <b><u>Its poison causes an additional 1d6 points of damage </u></b><u>if the victim fails a saving throw vs. poison </u>. Though it does not build webs, it can travel through webs of other spiders, and it can shoot web strands up to 3 feet. The web strands require normal attack rolls to hit; they cause no damage, but entangle a victim for 1d4 rounds.</p>
					<p>The <b>steeder </b>is a giant hunting spider with tarantula markings, 4+4 Hit Dice, and a movement rate of 12. It does not spin webs and cannot move in them, but its feet exude a sticky substance which allows it to cling to precarious surfaces, even if only one foot is touching the surface. The steeder also uses the secretions (50% of the time) to cling to prey; this requires an attack roll from the steeder, against AC 10 for the victim, adjusted only for magic and Dexterity. A victim can escape by making a successful Strength or Dexterity roll with a -10 penalty. While held, the victim suffers a -2 penalty to attack and damage rolls and is automatically bitten once per round.</p>
					<p>Duergar dwarves use steeders as mounts, fitting the spiders with complex saddles and control straps. A steeder can leap 240 feet, even with a rider. Leaps are considered charging attacks. A steeder moves on walls and ceilings at half its normal rate; duergar saddles are built for this kind of motion.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Phase Spider</b></p>
					<p>Phase spiders are web-spinners with a raised thorax and a human-like head; they are often confused with neogi or driders. They have a unique ability to phase in and out of the Prime material plane. They phase in, attack, and phase out, all in a single round. This gives them a -3 modifier on initiative rolls; if a phase spider wins initiative by more than 4, it attacks and phases out before its opponent has a chance to strike back. Then too, a phase spider usually phases into existence behind its chosen victim, so they get a +4 modifier for attacking from behind. Phase spiders flee to the Ethereal plane when outmatched; there, they gain only a -1 modifier to initiative and can be attacked every round, regardless of the initiative result. Phase spiders have Type F poison, and victims receive a -2 penalty on saving throws against it.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Sword Spider</b></p>
					<p>This giant hunting spider is native to jungles, but has been introduced into the Underdark by drow traders. It has a sleek, hairy, black body with brown stripes. Its legs have bony plates with sharp, raised ridges that cut like sword blades.</p>
					<p>Against formidable prey, a sword spider leaps horizontally as far as 30 feet, and lands legs forward, impaling its prey. Only one attack roll is made for the creature. If the attack is successful, the victim is struck by a number of legs based on its size: size S, three legs; size M, four legs; size L, five legs; size H, six legs; size G, all eight legs. If the spider's leap is greater than 20 feet, each leg receives a +1 bonus to damage. Any upward attack against the leaping spider receives a -4 to the attack roll, due to the impaling blades which protect the spider.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Gargantuan Spider</b></p>
					<p>The gargantuan spider, also called a whisper spider, is a hunting spider with red eyes, a black body, and two gray stripes along its abdomen. They usually live in huge webs in a forest or a cave, keeping treasure from prey in a small hole, or in the bole of a tree. The whisper spider has 8+8 Hit Dice. It can flatten itself to become 80% undetectable; it is so silent that opponents suffer a -5 penalty to surprise rolls.</p>
					<p>Using its webbing, it can make a false spider, a flapping banner, a filmy veil, or any shape it has ever seen; it uses these to mislead prey. The spider can make a web net to trap prey, or it can shoot web strands up to 2 feet to bind a foe. Either attack treats the spider's opponent as AC 10 and prevents the spider from making a melee attack that round. A victim caught by webbing is treated as if caught in a web spell. <b><u>When bitten, a victim must make a successful saving throw vs. poison, with a penalty of -2, or fall into a coma for 2d4 turns </u></b>.</p>
					<p><b>Giant marine spiders </b>are gargantuan spiders with 7+7 Hit Dice, which live in burrows near bodies of saltwater. Like their freshwater cousins, they carry prey to their lairs; though they collect no treasure, their lairs may contain incidental items from victims. They have type F poison, and do not share the whisper spider's special abilities.</p>

A victim can escape by making a successful Strength or Dexterity roll with a -10 penalty. While held, the victim suffers a -2 penalty to attack and damage rolls and is automatically bitten once per round.</p>
					<p>Duergar dwarves use steeders as mounts, fitting the spiders with complex saddles and control straps. A steeder can leap 240 feet, even with a rider. Leaps are considered charging attacks. A steeder moves on walls and ceilings at half its normal rate; duergar saddles are built for this kind of motion.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Phase Spider</b></p>
					<p>Phase spiders are web-spinners with a raised thorax and a human-like head; they are often confused with neogi or driders. They have a unique ability to phase in and out of the Prime material plane. They phase in, attack, and phase out, all in a single round. This gives them a -3 modifier on initiative rolls; if a phase spider wins initiative by more than 4, it attacks and phases out before its opponent has a chance to strike back. Then too, a phase spider usually phases into existence behind its chosen victim, so they get a +4 modifier for attacking from behind. Phase spiders flee to the Ethereal plane when outmatched; there, they gain only a -1 modifier to initiative and can be attacked every round, regardless of the initiative result. Phase spiders have Type F poison, and victims receive a -2 penalty on saving throws against it.</p>

					<p><b>Sword Spider</b></p>
					<p>This giant hunting spider is native to jungles, but has been introduced into the Underdark by drow traders. It has a sleek, hairy, black body with brown stripes. Its legs have bony plates with sharp, raised ridges that cut like sword blades.</p>
					<p>Against formidable prey, a sword spider leaps horizontally as far as 30 feet, and lands legs forward, impaling its prey. Only one attack roll is made for the creature. If the attack is successful, the victim is struck by a number of legs based on its size: size S, three legs; size M, four legs; size L, five legs; size H, six legs; size G, all eight legs. If the spider's leap is greater than 20 feet, each leg receives a +1 bonus to damage. Any upward attack against the leaping spider receives a -4 to the attack roll, due to the impaling blades which protect the spider.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Gargantuan Spider</b></p>
					<p>The gargantuan spider, also called a whisper spider, is a hunting spider with red eyes, a black body, and two gray stripes along its abdomen. They usually live in huge webs in a forest or a cave, keeping treasure from prey in a small hole, or in the bole of a tree. The whisper spider has 8+8 Hit Dice. It can flatten itself to become 80% undetectable; it is so silent that opponents suffer a -5 penalty to surprise rolls.</p>
					<p>Using its webbing, it can make a false spider, a flapping banner, a filmy veil, or any shape it has ever seen; it uses these to mislead prey. The spider can make a web net to trap prey, or it can shoot web strands up to 2 feet to bind a foe. Either attack treats the spider's opponent as AC 10 and prevents the spider from making a melee attack that round. A victim caught by webbing is treated as if caught in a web spell. <b><u>When bitten, a victim must make a successful saving throw vs. poison, with a penalty of -2, or fall into a coma for 2d4 turns </u></b>.</p>
					<p><b>Giant marine spiders </b>are gargantuan spiders with 7+7 Hit Dice, which live in burrows near bodies of saltwater. Like their freshwater cousins, they carry prey to their lairs; though they collect no treasure, their lairs may contain incidental items from victims. They have type F poison, and do not share the whisper spider's special abilities.</p>

					<p>Sprites are shy and reclusive faerie people, related to other faerie-folk, like brownies and leprechauns. There are several varieties, including pixies and nixies. Most have small, semitransparent wings, and elven features. Normal sprites have distinctly elven features and live in meadows and wooded glens. The wingless sea sprites make their homes on colorful coral reefs, living in harmony with the sea creatures, protecting the reefs' delicate environment, and frolicking in the waves. The naturally invisible pixies are perhaps the most intelligent and mischievous of the faeries; they dwell in idyllic woodlands and delight in harassing travelers with their pranks. Nixies are water sprites that live in freshwater lakes, and, while they harbor no grudges against humankind, they delight in enslaving men as their beasts of burden. Other sylvan creatures related to sprites include the swift atomies and the mischievous grigs, both forest-dwellers.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Sprites hate evil and ugliness, and are capable of stout militancy, should their secluded homes be invaded by orcs or worse. They fight with long, slim swords which do damage as a human-sized dagger, or their own special bows. Bows have a range half that of a human short bow and do only half as much damage (1-3 points). The tips of their arrows are coated with a special ointment concocted by the sprites. <b><u>Any creature struck by the drugged arrows, regardless of level, race, or magic resistance, must make a saving throw vs. poison or fall into a deep sleep lasting 1d6 hours </u></b>. Normally sprites do nothing more than take their victims to safe a place very far away (often confiscating their weapons in the process), though evil creatures may be slain.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Sprites prefer to avoid other intelligent beings and live in places where they can have many celebrations, parties, and gatherings. They gather on most moonlit nights for singing and dancing, land sprites in the glens, and water sprites in the surf. Land sprites live in sylvan woodlands, they monitor and protect forests and secluded glens. Water sprites protect their watery territories equally well.</p>
					<p>Most land-dwelling species of sprite are immortal, and never die unless killed. The sprites' diminutive size and their dangerous environments keep sprite populations low.</p>
					<p><b>Sprite (standard)</b></p>
					<p>Sprites usually speak only their own language, common, and elven, but seem to get along with woodland mammals and other creatures anyway. Humans often mistake sprites for butterflies at a distance, and it is guessed that the majority of forest creatures also think of the fair sprites in this way.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Sprites can become <i>invisible </i>at will and <i>detect good/evil </i>within 50 yards, so they are hard to deceive, evade, or capture. When invisible, sprites get +2 to attack rolls against opponents, who suffer a -4 penalty to hit the sprites.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Sprites are very flighty, and find even elves much too serious about most woodland affairs. Only druids deal with sprites regularly. Some druids even receive a little of their training in the company of a few sprites. Most sprites love druids, for their neutral alignment and love for nature make them see the forest in much the same way. On rare occasions, sprites associate with rangers as well.</p>
					<p>Sprites are loosely tribal, electing the best warrior among the group (male or female) as the group spokesperson. This leader is recognized as the one who makes major decisions and bargains with druids and elves. Sprites rarely wait for their leader's decision, often attacking an evil creature before the leader can issue any command.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Sprite sleep ointment is concocted from forest mushrooms. The ointment must be left to cure in the sun for seven days. Sprites hollow out tree stumps to serve as containers for this rare substance.</p>
					<p>Sprites keep watch on their fellow sprites, so they know who to invite to their frequent gatherings. A deserted meadow or glen is never empty for more than a decade before a new clan of sprites moves in.</p>
					<p><b>Sea Sprites</b></p>
					<p>Sea sprites have fine, cheerful faces, with rounded cheeks and wide, fish-like eyes. Their hair is the color and texture of seaweed, and reaches down to the gills on their necks, which enable sea sprites to breathe water as well as air. Their skin is light blue, smooth, and slick. Sea sprites have no wings, but webbing grows between their toes and fingers. Sea sprites wear bright, eelskin jerkins, and often adorn themselves with ornaments crafted from treasures found in the ocean.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>About half of the sea sprites encountered carry special crossbows. In the hands of sea sprites, these crossbows function like light crossbows above and below water. Sea sprites coat their crossbow bolts in sprite sleep ointment.</p>
					<p>Sea sprites hate and fear sahuagin, and kill those they put to sleep. Air breathers are left on a nearby beach provided they have neither harmed nor attempted to harm the coral reef.</p>
					<p>Sea sprites can turn <i>invisible </i>at will and <i>detect good/evil </i>within 50 yards. Three times per day, a sea sprite may cast <i>slow </i>, by touch, at the 5th level of ability. Once per day, a sea sprite can cast <i>airy water </i>as a 10th-level spellcaster.</p>
					<p>Sea sprites are 45% likely to be accompanied by ld6 large carnivorous fish, such as barracudas. These fish act as guards and pets, attacking any creature that threatens the sprites.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Sea sprites live in natural caves in coral reefs, or amid large wrecks. Though sea sprites can breathe air, they rarely set foot on land. Their homes are cheerfully decorated with a mishmash of seashells, bones, pearls, free-swimming and colorful pet fish, and artifacts taken from sunken ships. Sea sprites live in small communities of four or five families.While each community is led by the eldest male, the true power often rests in the hands of his mate.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Sea sprites eat seaweeds, small crustaceans, and fish. They raise fish and never deplete the reefs where they live. The only natural enemies of sea sprites are sahuagin. Sea sprites usually live for several centuries. They sometimes trade with sea elves but never mix socially with them.</p>
					<p><b>Pixie</b></p>
					<p>Pixies stand about 2 1/2 feet tall. When visible, they resemble small elves, but with longer ears. Pixies have two silver wings, like those of moths. They wear bright clothing, often with a cap and a pair of shoes with curled and pointed toes. Pixies speak their own language, Common, and the language of sprites.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Pixies carry sprite-sized swords and bows. They use three types of arrows, and shoot them with a +4 bonus to the attack roll. Besides standard sprite sleep-arrows, pixies use a war arrow, which inflicts <b>1d4+1 points of damage </b>, and an arrow which does no physical harm to the target. <b><u>Those hit by this arrow must make a successful saving throw vs. spell, or suffer complete loss of memory which can be restored only by a </u></b><b><i><u>heal </u></i></b><b><u>or a </u></b><b><i><u>limited wish </u></i></b>.</p>
					<p>Pixies can, once per day, use each of the following magical powers, as if they were 8th-level mages: <i>polymorph self </i>, <i>know alignment </i>, <i>dispel magic </i>, <i>dancing lights </i>, and <i>ESP </i>. They can also do the following once per day: become visible for as long as they desire; create illusions with both audial and visual components; and cause <i>confusion </i>by touch. Their illusions require no concentration and last until magically dispelled. <b><u>A creature attacked with confusion must make a successful saving throw vs. spell, or suffer its effects until a </u></b><b><i><u>remove curse </u></i></b><b><u>is applied </u></b>. One pixie in 10 can use Otto's <i>irresistible dance </i>, also once per day.</p>
					<p>Because pixies are normally invisible, opponents suffer a -4 penalty to attack rolls. A successful <i>dispel magic </i>against 8th-level magic makes any pixies, in its area of effect, visible for one round, then they automatically become invisible again. They attack while invisible without penalty.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Pixies live in deep forest caves, dancing in moonlit glades to the music of crickets and frogs. They are pranksters and they love to lead travelers astray. They use their illusion powers to accomplish this, hence the expression 'pixie-led' for one who has lost his way. They like to frighten maidens, rap on walls, blow out candles, and play in water.</p>
					<p>Pixies love to trick misers into giving away their treasure, especially by convincing them that something horrible will happen to them if they do not. Pixies carry no treasure, but sometimes have a hoard in their lair to impress visitors. Pixies use treasure to taunt greedy people, and then play merciless pranks on them until they abandon their search for the pixies' fortune. If the victim shows no greed and exhibits a good sense of humor about their pranks, the pixies may allow that individual to choose one item from their hoard.</p>
					<p>Pixies dwell together in a community of clans or families that seem to mimic human customs. Each family has a last name, and family and community loyalty is very important to pixies. Their life span is about 300 years.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Pixies eat fruits and nectar. The most famous by-product of pixies is pixie dust, also known as <i>dust of disappearance </i>. Crushing 50 pixie wings into a fine powder creates one dose of <i>dust of disappearance </i>. Naturally, pixies frown on this use of their wings.</p>
					<p><b>Nixie</b></p>
					<p>Nixies have webbed fingers and toes, pointed ears, and wide silver eyes. Most are slim and comely, and they have lightly scaled, pale green skin and dark green hair. Females are attractive, often twining shells and pearl strings in their thick hair, and they modestly dress in tight-fitting wraps woven from colorful seaweeds.</p>
					<p>Males wear loincloths of the same materials. Nixies can breathe both water and air; travel on land is possible, but they prefer not to leave their lakes. Nixies speak their own language and the Common tongue.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>If one or more humans approach within 30 feet of a group of nixies, the nixies pool their magic to create a powerful <i>charm </i>spell, one such spell per every 10 nixies. <b><u>The victim must make a saving throw vs. spell at -2 on the die roll </u></b>. Before a <i>charmed </i>humans enters the water, there is a 75% chance that a <i>dispel magic </i>will break the charm. Once the victim is in the water, the chance of <i>dispelling </i>the magic drops to 10%.</p>
					<p>Nixies keep each <i>charmed </i>slave for one full year, forcing him to do all their heavy labor, but thereafter the <i>charm </i>wears off and the victim is set free. During this enslavement, the nixies keep a <i>water breathing </i>spell on the human captive. Nixies can cast this spell on any creature, or dispel it, once per day; the spell's duration is one day.</p>
					<p>Male nixies carry daggers and javelins. The javelins are used to spear things in the water, or can be thrown. A group of 10 nixies can use a large fishing net against adversaries who are in the water with them. Nixies make one net attack against AC 10 to ensnare a single man-sized creature, -2 AC for each additional victim, up to five total victims (and AC 0). Nixies sometimes employ guardian fish in battle.</p>
					<p>Even with 25% magic resistance, nixies fear fire and very bright lights, so a <i>flaming sword </i>or a <i>light </i>spell keeps them at bay. Nixies try to negate a <i>continual light </i>spell by summoning small fish to crowd around the light and dim it.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Nixie dwellings are woven from living seaweed and difficult to detect (5% chance within 20 feet, impossible from farther away). Nixies keep giant fish as guards, either 1-2 gar (20%) or 2-5 pike (80%); these are taught to obey simple commands. Small bright, ornamental fish are kept as pets and trained to perform elaborate tricks. Trout, bass, and catfish are herded as food. Nixies can also summon 10-100 small fish, which takes 1-3 rounds.</p>
					<p>Nixie tribes have 20-80 members, about one third are youth. Families have 4-8 members, and the tribe usually includes 10-15 families, all related through common ancestors. A nixie tribe controls an area with a radius of 3-5 miles; when a tribe gets too large, 2-3 families split off to form a new tribe. Nixies live for several centuries.</p>
					<p>Nixie tribes are ruled by the Acquar (water mother), a hereditary position held by a direct descendant of the original founding ancestor. She decides major disputes and chooses the most apt warrior to be the S'oquar, the warlord responsible for hunting and defense. The Acquar is advised by a council of elders, whose spokesperson is called the L'uquar, the keeper of the tribe's oral history. Treasures, whether the spoils of war or the results of work or luck, are divided equally by the Acquar. Intertribal rivalries are often fierce, and females are sometimes kidnapped as brides, for nixies are polygamists, keeping 2-3 wives. Nixies worship water and nature powers.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Lakes with nixie tribes are kept clean and well stocked; often, human slaves work to improve the environment through the removal of trash and obstructions. Nixie artifacts include jewelry of shells, pearls and opals, silk from water spiders, and <i>potions of water breathing </i>.</p>
					<p><b>Atomie</b></p>
					<p>Atomies avoid most serious-minded creatures, but mix freely with grigs, and are 20% likely to be found in their company. The lightest and quickest of all the sprites, atomies are less than 1-foot tall. Atomies have four dragonfly-like wings. Their features are elven, their skin is pale with a hint of woodland green. Atomie clothing is innately magical, bright and festive while at the same time blending with woodland surroundings.</p>
					<p>Atomies have twice the hearing range of humans, and they have infravision to 90 feet. Their voices are high-pitched, almost a bee-like buzz. Atomies speak their own language and often the languages of sprites, pixies, and some broken Common. They can also speak with plants and animals.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Atomies attack as 3rd-level fighters. About 20% of atomies carry tiny crossbows and spears. Atomie crossbows have a 3-foot range and inflict <b>1d3 points of damage </b>. Atomie spears cause <b>1d4 points of damage </b>. The remaining atomies are armed with either spears (40%) or sprite swords (40%). Atomies have the following magical abilities, usable once per round at 5th-level ability: <i>blink </i>, <i>invisibility </i>, <i>pass plant </i>, <i>speak with animals </i>, and <i>summon insects </i>.</p>
					<p>Atomies are surprised only on a 1; opponents suffer a -6 penalty to surprise rolls. Upon hearing an intruder, atomies hide and try to make the intruder go away, using false lights, clattering voices, and pesky, summoned insects. Repeat intruders are warned with crossbow bolts. If combat is inevitable, or the intruders are orcs, the atomies regroup and attack. Atomies with spears fly in and dive on surprised opponents (usually aiming at their posteriors). Diving attacks inflict double damage (2d4).</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Atomies live in the upper branches of old hardwood trees (usually oaks), one family per tree. Each family hollows out a series of tiny rooms, decorating with walnut chairs, woven pine needle rugs, acorn dishes, and the like. A network of balconies, landings, and rope bridges connects the dwellings, forming a village high above the forest floor. A typical atomie village houses 3d4x10 adults and 4d6 children.</p>
					<p>Atomies seldom bother with outsiders, even standard sprites (whom they view as tedious and too serious), but they will sometimes help a lost child. A rescued child is well cared for and entertained before being returned to the outside world.</p>
					<p>The concept of pets is unknown, but atomies often grow mushroom 'friends' in their living rooms.</p>
					<p>Atomies have loose leadership, choosing a chieftain based on storytelling and singing ability.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Atomies are herbivores and find the eating habits of their cousins repulsive. They favor nuts above fruit, and prefer honey when they can trick bees into giving them some.</p>
					<p>Atomies make a perfect, bite-sized morsels for most creatures, and sometimes fall prey to evil animals, such as worgs.</p>
					<p>Atomies view magic as a force connected with life and are fascinated by inanimate magical items. Atomies collect magical items and display them in their homes or communities. Non-magical treasures are considered clutter and are either thrown away or given to forest creatures who value such things.</p>
					<p><b>Grigs</b></p>
					<p>Grigs are mischievous and lighthearted. They have no fear of big people and take great joy in playing tricks upon them.</p>
					<p>A grig has the head, torso, and arms of a sprite, with the wings, antennae, and legs of a cricket. They can leap great distances. Grigs have light blue skin, forest green hair, and brown hairy legs. They usually wear tunics or brightly colored vests with buttons made from tiny gems. Grigs speak atomie, brownie, pixie, sprite, and Common. They have double normal hearing range and 180-foot infravision. The origin of the grigs remains a mystery.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Fierce (by sprite standards), each grig carries six small darts and a sprite sword. Grigs gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls with darts. Darts and swords do normal damage when used by grigs, but only 1 point of damage when used by non-grigs.</p>
					<p>Grigs have the following spell-like abilities, usable once per round at 6th-level ability: <i>change self </i>, <i>entangle </i>, <i>invisibility </i>, <i>pyrotechnics </i>, <i>trip </i>, and <i>ventriloquism </i>. Grigs move silently in woodlands; they are surprised only on a 1, while opponents suffer a -6 penalty to surprise rolls. Some grigs throw darts, while others leap to attack, and one grig fiddler (grigs never go anywhere without a fiddle), plays a song with the same effect as <i>Otto's irresistible dance </i>. <b><u>All non-sprites within 30 feet of the fiddler must make a successful saving throw vs. spell or dance until the grig ceases playing </u></b>. Grigs can play for hours.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Grigs roam the forests in small bands. They have no permanent homes but often sleep in the limbs of treants, or near unicorns (who protect grigs even unto death).</p>
					<p>Grigs are cautious but trusting. They delight in playing pranks on big people. Common ploys include stealing food, collapsing a tent, and using <i>ventriloquism </i>to make objects talk. Once a prank is set, the grigs sit back and watch, laughing at the unfortunate person. People who make fools of themselves are apt to be plagued by harmless jokes until they reach the forest edge. At that point, one of the grigs comes out of hiding and makes amends with a gift, either a harmless bauble such as a 1d6x100 gp gem (25%) or a precious jar of really fresh honey (75%).</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Grigs live on nuts, berries and honey, like their atomie cousins.</p>

					<p>Sprites are shy and reclusive faerie people, related to other faerie-folk, like brownies and leprechauns. There are several varieties, including pixies and nixies. Most have small, semitransparent wings, and elven features. Normal sprites have distinctly elven features and live in meadows and wooded glens. The wingless sea sprites make their homes on colorful coral reefs, living in harmony with the sea creatures, protecting the reefs' delicate environment, and frolicking in the waves. The naturally invisible pixies are perhaps the most intelligent and mischievous of the faeries; they dwell in idyllic woodlands and delight in harassing travelers with their pranks. Nixies are water sprites that live in freshwater lakes, and, while they harbor no grudges against humankind, they delight in enslaving men as their beasts of burden. Other sylvan creatures related to sprites include the swift atomies and the mischievous grigs, both forest-dwellers.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Sprites hate evil and ugliness, and are capable of stout militancy, should their secluded homes be invaded by orcs or worse. They fight with long, slim swords which do damage as a human-sized dagger, or their own special bows. Bows have a range half that of a human short bow and do only half as much damage (1-3 points). The tips of their arrows are coated with a special ointment concocted by the sprites. <b><u>Any creature struck by the drugged arrows, regardless of level, race, or magic resistance, must make a saving throw vs. poison or fall into a deep sleep lasting 1d6 hours </u></b>. Normally sprites do nothing more than take their victims to safe a place very far away (often confiscating their weapons in the process), though evil creatures may be slain.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Sprites prefer to avoid other intelligent beings and live in places where they can have many celebrations, parties, and gatherings. They gather on most moonlit nights for singing and dancing, land sprites in the glens, and water sprites in the surf. Land sprites live in sylvan woodlands, they monitor and protect forests and secluded glens. Water sprites protect their watery territories equally well.</p>
					<p>Most land-dwelling species of sprite are immortal, and never die unless killed. The sprites' diminutive size and their dangerous environments keep sprite populations low.</p>
					<p><b>Sprite (standard)</b></p>
					<p>Sprites usually speak only their own language, common, and elven, but seem to get along with woodland mammals and other creatures anyway. Humans often mistake sprites for butterflies at a distance, and it is guessed that the majority of forest creatures also think of the fair sprites in this way.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Sprites can become <i>invisible </i>at will and <i>detect good/evil </i>within 50 yards, so they are hard to deceive, evade, or capture. When invisible, sprites get +2 to attack rolls against opponents, who suffer a -4 penalty to hit the sprites.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Sprites are very flighty, and find even elves much too serious about most woodland affairs. Only druids deal with sprites regularly. Some druids even receive a little of their training in the company of a few sprites. Most sprites love druids, for their neutral alignment and love for nature make them see the forest in much the same way. On rare occasions, sprites associate with rangers as well.</p>
					<p>Sprites are loosely tribal, electing the best warrior among the group (male or female) as the group spokesperson. This leader is recognized as the one who makes major decisions and bargains with druids and elves. Sprites rarely wait for their leader's decision, often attacking an evil creature before the leader can issue any command.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Sprite sleep ointment is concocted from forest mushrooms. The ointment must be left to cure in the sun for seven days. Sprites hollow out tree stumps to serve as containers for this rare substance.</p>
					<p>Sprites keep watch on their fellow sprites, so they know who to invite to their frequent gatherings. A deserted meadow or glen is never empty for more than a decade before a new clan of sprites moves in.</p>
					<p><b>Sea Sprites</b></p>
					<p>Sea sprites have fine, cheerful faces, with rounded cheeks and wide, fish-like eyes. Their hair is the color and texture of seaweed, and reaches down to the gills on their necks, which enable sea sprites to breathe water as well as air. Their skin is light blue, smooth, and slick. Sea sprites have no wings, but webbing grows between their toes and fingers. Sea sprites wear bright, eelskin jerkins, and often adorn themselves with ornaments crafted from treasures found in the ocean.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>About half of the sea sprites encountered carry special crossbows. In the hands of sea sprites, these crossbows function like light crossbows above and below water. Sea sprites coat their crossbow bolts in sprite sleep ointment.</p>
					<p>Sea sprites hate and fear sahuagin, and kill those they put to sleep. Air breathers are left on a nearby beach provided they have neither harmed nor attempted to harm the coral reef.</p>
					<p>Sea sprites can turn <i>invisible </i>at will and <i>detect good/evil </i>within 50 yards. Three times per day, a sea sprite may cast <i>slow </i>, by touch, at the 5th level of ability. Once per day, a sea sprite can cast <i>airy water </i>as a 10th-level spellcaster.</p>
					<p>Sea sprites are 45% likely to be accompanied by ld6 large carnivorous fish, such as barracudas. These fish act as guards and pets, attacking any creature that threatens the sprites.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Sea sprites live in natural caves in coral reefs, or amid large wrecks. Though sea sprites can breathe air, they rarely set foot on land. Their homes are cheerfully decorated with a mishmash of seashells, bones, pearls, free-swimming and colorful pet fish, and artifacts taken from sunken ships. Sea sprites live in small communities of four or five families.While each community is led by the eldest male, the true power often rests in the hands of his mate.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Sea sprites eat seaweeds, small crustaceans, and fish. They raise fish and never deplete the reefs where they live. The only natural enemies of sea sprites are sahuagin. Sea sprites usually live for several centuries. They sometimes trade with sea elves but never mix socially with them.</p>
					<p><b>Pixie</b></p>
					<p>Pixies stand about 2 1/2 feet tall. When visible, they resemble small elves, but with longer ears. Pixies have two silver wings, like those of moths. They wear bright clothing, often with a cap and a pair of shoes with curled and pointed toes. Pixies speak their own language, Common, and the language of sprites.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Pixies carry sprite-sized swords and bows. They use three types of arrows, and shoot them with a +4 bonus to the attack roll. Besides standard sprite sleep-arrows, pixies use a war arrow, which inflicts <b>1d4+1 points of damage </b>, and an arrow which does no physical harm to the target. <b><u>Those hit by this arrow must make a successful saving throw vs. spell, or suffer complete loss of memory which can be restored only by a </u></b><b><i><u>heal </u></i></b><b><u>or a </u></b><b><i><u>limited wish </u></i></b>.</p>
					<p>Pixies can, once per day, use each of the following magical powers, as if they were 8th-level mages: <i>polymorph self </i>, <i>know alignment </i>, <i>dispel magic </i>, <i>dancing lights </i>, and <i>ESP </i>. They can also do the following once per day: become visible for as long as they desire; create illusions with both audial and visual components; and cause <i>confusion </i>by touch. Their illusions require no concentration and last until magically dispelled. <b><u>A creature attacked with confusion must make a successful saving throw vs. spell, or suffer its effects until a </u></b><b><i><u>remove curse </u></i></b><b><u>is applied </u></b>. One pixie in 10 can use Otto's <i>irresistible dance </i>, also once per day.</p>
					<p>Because pixies are normally invisible, opponents suffer a -4 penalty to attack rolls. A successful <i>dispel magic </i>against 8th-level magic makes any pixies, in its area of effect, visible for one round, then they automatically become invisible again. They attack while invisible without penalty.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Pixies live in deep forest caves, dancing in moonlit glades to the music of crickets and frogs. They are pranksters and they love to lead travelers astray. They use their illusion powers to accomplish this, hence the expression 'pixie-led' for one who has lost his way. They like to frighten maidens, rap on walls, blow out candles, and play in water.</p>
					<p>Pixies love to trick misers into giving away their treasure, especially by convincing them that something horrible will happen to them if they do not. Pixies carry no treasure, but sometimes have a hoard in their lair to impress visitors. Pixies use treasure to taunt greedy people, and then play merciless pranks on them until they abandon their search for the pixies' fortune. If the victim shows no greed and exhibits a good sense of humor about their pranks, the pixies may allow that individual to choose one item from their hoard.</p>
					<p>Pixies dwell together in a community of clans or families that seem to mimic human customs. Each family has a last name, and family and community loyalty is very important to pixies. Their life span is about 300 years.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Pixies eat fruits and nectar. The most famous by-product of pixies is pixie dust, also known as <i>dust of disappearance </i>. Crushing 50 pixie wings into a fine powder creates one dose of <i>dust of disappearance </i>. Naturally, pixies frown on this use of their wings.</p>
					<p><b>Nixie</b></p>
					<p>Nixies have webbed fingers and toes, pointed ears, and wide silver eyes. Most are slim and comely, and they have lightly scaled, pale green skin and dark green hair. Females are attractive, often twining shells and pearl strings in their thick hair, and they modestly dress in tight-fitting wraps woven from colorful seaweeds.</p>
					<p>Males wear loincloths of the same materials. Nixies can breathe both water and air; travel on land is possible, but they prefer not to leave their lakes. Nixies speak their own language and the Common tongue.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>If one or more humans approach within 30 feet of a group of nixies, the nixies pool their magic to create a powerful <i>charm </i>spell, one such spell per every 10 nixies. <b><u>The victim must make a saving throw vs. spell at -2 on the die roll </u></b>. Before a <i>charmed </i>humans enters the water, there is a 75% chance that a <i>dispel magic </i>will break the charm. Once the victim is in the water, the chance of <i>dispelling </i>the magic drops to 10%.</p>
					<p>Nixies keep each <i>charmed </i>slave for one full year, forcing him to do all their heavy labor, but thereafter the <i>charm </i>wears off and the victim is set free. During this enslavement, the nixies keep a <i>water breathing </i>spell on the human captive. Nixies can cast this spell on any creature, or dispel it, once per day; the spell's duration is one day.</p>
					<p>Male nixies carry daggers and javelins. The javelins are used to spear things in the water, or can be thrown. A group of 10 nixies can use a large fishing net against adversaries who are in the water with them. Nixies make one net attack against AC 10 to ensnare a single man-sized creature, -2 AC for each additional victim, up to five total victims (and AC 0). Nixies sometimes employ guardian fish in battle.</p>
					<p>Even with 25% magic resistance, nixies fear fire and very bright lights, so a <i>flaming sword </i>or a <i>light </i>spell keeps them at bay. Nixies try to negate a <i>continual light </i>spell by summoning small fish to crowd around the light and dim it.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Nixie dwellings are woven from living seaweed and difficult to detect (5% chance within 20 feet, impossible from farther away). Nixies keep giant fish as guards, either 1-2 gar (20%) or 2-5 pike (80%); these are taught to obey simple commands. Small bright, ornamental fish are kept as pets and trained to perform elaborate tricks. Trout, bass, and catfish are herded as food. Nixies can also summon 10-100 small fish, which takes 1-3 rounds.</p>
					<p>Nixie tribes have 20-80 members, about one third are youth. Families have 4-8 members, and the tribe usually includes 10-15 families, all related through common ancestors. A nixie tribe controls an area with a radius of 3-5 miles; when a tribe gets too large, 2-3 families split off to form a new tribe. Nixies live for several centuries.</p>
					<p>Nixie tribes are ruled by the Acquar (water mother), a hereditary position held by a direct descendant of the original founding ancestor. She decides major disputes and chooses the most apt warrior to be the S'oquar, the warlord responsible for hunting and defense. The Acquar is advised by a council of elders, whose spokesperson is called the L'uquar, the keeper of the tribe's oral history. Treasures, whether the spoils of war or the results of work or luck, are divided equally by the Acquar. Intertribal rivalries are often fierce, and females are sometimes kidnapped as brides, for nixies are polygamists, keeping 2-3 wives. Nixies worship water and nature powers.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Lakes with nixie tribes are kept clean and well stocked; often, human slaves work to improve the environment through the removal of trash and obstructions. Nixie artifacts include jewelry of shells, pearls and opals, silk from water spiders, and <i>potions of water breathing </i>.</p>
					<p><b>Atomie</b></p>
					<p>Atomies avoid most serious-minded creatures, but mix freely with grigs, and are 20% likely to be found in their company. The lightest and quickest of all the sprites, atomies are less than 1-foot tall. Atomies have four dragonfly-like wings. Their features are elven, their skin is pale with a hint of woodland green. Atomie clothing is innately magical, bright and festive while at the same time blending with woodland surroundings.</p>
					<p>Atomies have twice the hearing range of humans, and they have infravision to 90 feet. Their voices are high-pitched, almost a bee-like buzz. Atomies speak their own language and often the languages of sprites, pixies, and some broken Common. They can also speak with plants and animals.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Atomies attack as 3rd-level fighters. About 20% of atomies carry tiny crossbows and spears. Atomie crossbows have a 3-foot range and inflict <b>1d3 points of damage </b>. Atomie spears cause <b>1d4 points of damage </b>. The remaining atomies are armed with either spears (40%) or sprite swords (40%). Atomies have the following magical abilities, usable once per round at 5th-level ability: <i>blink </i>, <i>invisibility </i>, <i>pass plant </i>, <i>speak with animals </i>, and <i>summon insects </i>.</p>
					<p>Atomies are surprised only on a 1; opponents suffer a -6 penalty to surprise rolls. Upon hearing an intruder, atomies hide and try to make the intruder go away, using false lights, clattering voices, and pesky, summoned insects. Repeat intruders are warned with crossbow bolts. If combat is inevitable, or the intruders are orcs, the atomies regroup and attack. Atomies with spears fly in and dive on surprised opponents (usually aiming at their posteriors). Diving attacks inflict double damage (2d4).</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Atomies live in the upper branches of old hardwood trees (usually oaks), one family per tree. Each family hollows out a series of tiny rooms, decorating with walnut chairs, woven pine needle rugs, acorn dishes, and the like. A network of balconies, landings, and rope bridges connects the dwellings, forming a village high above the forest floor. A typical atomie village houses 3d4x10 adults and 4d6 children.</p>
					<p>Atomies seldom bother with outsiders, even standard sprites (whom they view as tedious and too serious), but they will sometimes help a lost child. A rescued child is well cared for and entertained before being returned to the outside world.</p>
					<p>The concept of pets is unknown, but atomies often grow mushroom 'friends' in their living rooms.</p>
					<p>Atomies have loose leadership, choosing a chieftain based on storytelling and singing ability.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Atomies are herbivores and find the eating habits of their cousins repulsive. They favor nuts above fruit, and prefer honey when they can trick bees into giving them some.</p>
					<p>Atomies make a perfect, bite-sized morsels for most creatures, and sometimes fall prey to evil animals, such as worgs.</p>
					<p>Atomies view magic as a force connected with life and are fascinated by inanimate magical items. Atomies collect magical items and display them in their homes or communities. Non-magical treasures are considered clutter and are either thrown away or given to forest creatures who value such things.</p>
					<p><b>Grigs</b></p>
					<p>Grigs are mischievous and lighthearted. They have no fear of big people and take great joy in playing tricks upon them.</p>
					<p>A grig has the head, torso, and arms of a sprite, with the wings, antennae, and legs of a cricket. They can leap great distances. Grigs have light blue skin, forest green hair, and brown hairy legs. They usually wear tunics or brightly colored vests with buttons made from tiny gems. Grigs speak atomie, brownie, pixie, sprite, and Common. They have double normal hearing range and 180-foot infravision. The origin of the grigs remains a mystery.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Fierce (by sprite standards), each grig carries six small darts and a sprite sword. Grigs gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls with darts. Darts and swords do normal damage when used by grigs, but only 1 point of damage when used by non-grigs.</p>
					<p>Grigs have the following spell-like abilities, usable once per round at 6th-level ability: <i>change self </i>, <i>entangle </i>, <i>invisibility </i>, <i>pyrotechnics </i>, <i>trip </i>, and <i>ventriloquism </i>. Grigs move silently in woodlands; they are surprised only on a 1, while opponents suffer a -6 penalty to surprise rolls. Some grigs throw darts, while others leap to attack, and one grig fiddler (grigs never go anywhere without a fiddle), plays a song with the same effect as <i>Otto's irresistible dance </i>. <b><u>All non-sprites within 30 feet of the fiddler must make a successful saving throw vs. spell or dance until the grig ceases playing </u></b>. Grigs can play for hours.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Grigs roam the forests in small bands. They have no permanent homes but often sleep in the limbs of treants, or near unicorns (who protect grigs even unto death).</p>
					<p>Grigs are cautious but trusting. They delight in playing pranks on big people. Common ploys include stealing food, collapsing a tent, and using <i>ventriloquism </i>to make objects talk. Once a prank is set, the grigs sit back and watch, laughing at the unfortunate person. People who make fools of themselves are apt to be plagued by harmless jokes until they reach the forest edge. At that point, one of the grigs comes out of hiding and makes amends with a gift, either a harmless bauble such as a 1d6x100 gp gem (25%) or a precious jar of really fresh honey (75%).</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Grigs live on nuts, berries and honey, like their atomie cousins.</p>

					<p>Sprites are shy and reclusive faerie people, related to other faerie-folk, like brownies and leprechauns. There are several varieties, including pixies and nixies. Most have small, semitransparent wings, and elven features. Normal sprites have distinctly elven features and live in meadows and wooded glens. The wingless sea sprites make their homes on colorful coral reefs, living in harmony with the sea creatures, protecting the reefs' delicate environment, and frolicking in the waves. The naturally invisible pixies are perhaps the most intelligent and mischievous of the faeries; they dwell in idyllic woodlands and delight in harassing travelers with their pranks. Nixies are water sprites that live in freshwater lakes, and, while they harbor no grudges against humankind, they delight in enslaving men as their beasts of burden. Other sylvan creatures related to sprites include the swift atomies and the mischievous grigs, both forest-dwellers.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Sprites hate evil and ugliness, and are capable of stout militancy, should their secluded homes be invaded by orcs or worse. They fight with long, slim swords which do damage as a human-sized dagger, or their own special bows. Bows have a range half that of a human short bow and do only half as much damage (1-3 points). The tips of their arrows are coated with a special ointment concocted by the sprites. <b><u>Any creature struck by the drugged arrows, regardless of level, race, or magic resistance, must make a saving throw vs. poison or fall into a deep sleep lasting 1d6 hours </u></b>. Normally sprites do nothing more than take their victims to safe a place very far away (often confiscating their weapons in the process), though evil creatures may be slain.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Sprites prefer to avoid other intelligent beings and live in places where they can have many celebrations, parties, and gatherings. They gather on most moonlit nights for singing and dancing, land sprites in the glens, and water sprites in the surf. Land sprites live in sylvan woodlands, they monitor and protect forests and secluded glens. Water sprites protect their watery territories equally well.</p>
					<p>Most land-dwelling species of sprite are immortal, and never die unless killed. The sprites' diminutive size and their dangerous environments keep sprite populations low.</p>
					<p><b>Sprite (standard)</b></p>
					<p>Sprites usually speak only their own language, common, and elven, but seem to get along with woodland mammals and other creatures anyway. Humans often mistake sprites for butterflies at a distance, and it is guessed that the majority of forest creatures also think of the fair sprites in this way.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Sprites can become <i>invisible </i>at will and <i>detect good/evil </i>within 50 yards, so they are hard to deceive, evade, or capture. When invisible, sprites get +2 to attack rolls against opponents, who suffer a -4 penalty to hit the sprites.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Sprites are very flighty, and find even elves much too serious about most woodland affairs. Only druids deal with sprites regularly. Some druids even receive a little of their training in the company of a few sprites. Most sprites love druids, for their neutral alignment and love for nature make them see the forest in much the same way. On rare occasions, sprites associate with rangers as well.</p>
					<p>Sprites are loosely tribal, electing the best warrior among the group (male or female) as the group spokesperson. This leader is recognized as the one who makes major decisions and bargains with druids and elves. Sprites rarely wait for their leader's decision, often attacking an evil creature before the leader can issue any command.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Sprite sleep ointment is concocted from forest mushrooms. The ointment must be left to cure in the sun for seven days. Sprites hollow out tree stumps to serve as containers for this rare substance.</p>
					<p>Sprites keep watch on their fellow sprites, so they know who to invite to their frequent gatherings. A deserted meadow or glen is never empty for more than a decade before a new clan of sprites moves in.</p>
					<p><b>Sea Sprites</b></p>
					<p>Sea sprites have fine, cheerful faces, with rounded cheeks and wide, fish-like eyes. Their hair is the color and texture of seaweed, and reaches down to the gills on their necks, which enable sea sprites to breathe water as well as air. Their skin is light blue, smooth, and slick. Sea sprites have no wings, but webbing grows between their toes and fingers. Sea sprites wear bright, eelskin jerkins, and often adorn themselves with ornaments crafted from treasures found in the ocean.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>About half of the sea sprites encountered carry special crossbows. In the hands of sea sprites, these crossbows function like light crossbows above and below water. Sea sprites coat their crossbow bolts in sprite sleep ointment.</p>
					<p>Sea sprites hate and fear sahuagin, and kill those they put to sleep. Air breathers are left on a nearby beach provided they have neither harmed nor attempted to harm the coral reef.</p>
					<p>Sea sprites can turn <i>invisible </i>at will and <i>detect good/evil </i>within 50 yards. Three times per day, a sea sprite may cast <i>slow </i>, by touch, at the 5th level of ability. Once per day, a sea sprite can cast <i>airy water </i>as a 10th-level spellcaster.</p>
					<p>Sea sprites are 45% likely to be accompanied by ld6 large carnivorous fish, such as barracudas. These fish act as guards and pets, attacking any creature that threatens the sprites.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Sea sprites live in natural caves in coral reefs, or amid large wrecks. Though sea sprites can breathe air, they rarely set foot on land. Their homes are cheerfully decorated with a mishmash of seashells, bones, pearls, free-swimming and colorful pet fish, and artifacts taken from sunken ships. Sea sprites live in small communities of four or five families.While each community is led by the eldest male, the true power often rests in the hands of his mate.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Sea sprites eat seaweeds, small crustaceans, and fish. They raise fish and never deplete the reefs where they live. The only natural enemies of sea sprites are sahuagin. Sea sprites usually live for several centuries. They sometimes trade with sea elves but never mix socially with them.</p>
					<p><b>Pixie</b></p>
					<p>Pixies stand about 2 1/2 feet tall. When visible, they resemble small elves, but with longer ears. Pixies have two silver wings, like those of moths. They wear bright clothing, often with a cap and a pair of shoes with curled and pointed toes. Pixies speak their own language, Common, and the language of sprites.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Pixies carry sprite-sized swords and bows. They use three types of arrows, and shoot them with a +4 bonus to the attack roll. Besides standard sprite sleep-arrows, pixies use a war arrow, which inflicts <b>1d4+1 points of damage </b>, and an arrow which does no physical harm to the target. <b><u>Those hit by this arrow must make a successful saving throw vs. spell, or suffer complete loss of memory which can be restored only by a </u></b><b><i><u>heal </u></i></b><b><u>or a </u></b><b><i><u>limited wish </u></i></b>.</p>
					<p>Pixies can, once per day, use each of the following magical powers, as if they were 8th-level mages: <i>polymorph self </i>, <i>know alignment </i>, <i>dispel magic </i>, <i>dancing lights </i>, and <i>ESP </i>. They can also do the following once per day: become visible for as long as they desire; create illusions with both audial and visual components; and cause <i>confusion </i>by touch. Their illusions require no concentration and last until magically dispelled. <b><u>A creature attacked with confusion must make a successful saving throw vs. spell, or suffer its effects until a </u></b><b><i><u>remove curse </u></i></b><b><u>is applied </u></b>. One pixie in 10 can use Otto's <i>irresistible dance </i>, also once per day.</p>
					<p>Because pixies are normally invisible, opponents suffer a -4 penalty to attack rolls. A successful <i>dispel magic </i>against 8th-level magic makes any pixies, in its area of effect, visible for one round, then they automatically become invisible again. They attack while invisible without penalty.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Pixies live in deep forest caves, dancing in moonlit glades to the music of crickets and frogs. They are pranksters and they love to lead travelers astray. They use their illusion powers to accomplish this, hence the expression 'pixie-led' for one who has lost his way. They like to frighten maidens, rap on walls, blow out candles, and play in water.</p>
					<p>Pixies love to trick misers into giving away their treasure, especially by convincing them that something horrible will happen to them if they do not. Pixies carry no treasure, but sometimes have a hoard in their lair to impress visitors. Pixies use treasure to taunt greedy people, and then play merciless pranks on them until they abandon their search for the pixies' fortune. If the victim shows no greed and exhibits a good sense of humor about their pranks, the pixies may allow that individual to choose one item from their hoard.</p>
					<p>Pixies dwell together in a community of clans or families that seem to mimic human customs. Each family has a last name, and family and community loyalty is very important to pixies. Their life span is about 300 years.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Pixies eat fruits and nectar. The most famous by-product of pixies is pixie dust, also known as <i>dust of disappearance </i>. Crushing 50 pixie wings into a fine powder creates one dose of <i>dust of disappearance </i>. Naturally, pixies frown on this use of their wings.</p>
					<p><b>Nixie</b></p>
					<p>Nixies have webbed fingers and toes, pointed ears, and wide silver eyes. Most are slim and comely, and they have lightly scaled, pale green skin and dark green hair. Females are attractive, often twining shells and pearl strings in their thick hair, and they modestly dress in tight-fitting wraps woven from colorful seaweeds.</p>
					<p>Males wear loincloths of the same materials. Nixies can breathe both water and air; travel on land is possible, but they prefer not to leave their lakes. Nixies speak their own language and the Common tongue.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>If one or more humans approach within 30 feet of a group of nixies, the nixies pool their magic to create a powerful <i>charm </i>spell, one such spell per every 10 nixies. <b><u>The victim must make a saving throw vs. spell at -2 on the die roll </u></b>. Before a <i>charmed </i>humans enters the water, there is a 75% chance that a <i>dispel magic </i>will break the charm. Once the victim is in the water, the chance of <i>dispelling </i>the magic drops to 10%.</p>
					<p>Nixies keep each <i>charmed </i>slave for one full year, forcing him to do all their heavy labor, but thereafter the <i>charm </i>wears off and the victim is set free. During this enslavement, the nixies keep a <i>water breathing </i>spell on the human captive. Nixies can cast this spell on any creature, or dispel it, once per day; the spell's duration is one day.</p>
					<p>Male nixies carry daggers and javelins. The javelins are used to spear things in the water, or can be thrown. A group of 10 nixies can use a large fishing net against adversaries who are in the water with them. Nixies make one net attack against AC 10 to ensnare a single man-sized creature, -2 AC for each additional victim, up to five total victims (and AC 0). Nixies sometimes employ guardian fish in battle.</p>
					<p>Even with 25% magic resistance, nixies fear fire and very bright lights, so a <i>flaming sword </i>or a <i>light </i>spell keeps them at bay. Nixies try to negate a <i>continual light </i>spell by summoning small fish to crowd around the light and dim it.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Nixie dwellings are woven from living seaweed and difficult to detect (5% chance within 20 feet, impossible from farther away). Nixies keep giant fish as guards, either 1-2 gar (20%) or 2-5 pike (80%); these are taught to obey simple commands. Small bright, ornamental fish are kept as pets and trained to perform elaborate tricks. Trout, bass, and catfish are herded as food. Nixies can also summon 10-100 small fish, which takes 1-3 rounds.</p>
					<p>Nixie tribes have 20-80 members, about one third are youth. Families have 4-8 members, and the tribe usually includes 10-15 families, all related through common ancestors. A nixie tribe controls an area with a radius of 3-5 miles; when a tribe gets too large, 2-3 families split off to form a new tribe. Nixies live for several centuries.</p>
					<p>Nixie tribes are ruled by the Acquar (water mother), a hereditary position held by a direct descendant of the original founding ancestor. She decides major disputes and chooses the most apt warrior to be the S'oquar, the warlord responsible for hunting and defense. The Acquar is advised by a council of elders, whose spokesperson is called the L'uquar, the keeper of the tribe's oral history. Treasures, whether the spoils of war or the results of work or luck, are divided equally by the Acquar. Intertribal rivalries are often fierce, and females are sometimes kidnapped as brides, for nixies are polygamists, keeping 2-3 wives. Nixies worship water and nature powers.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Lakes with nixie tribes are kept clean and well stocked; often, human slaves work to improve the environment through the removal of trash and obstructions. Nixie artifacts include jewelry of shells, pearls and opals, silk from water spiders, and <i>potions of water breathing </i>.</p>
					<p><b>Atomie</b></p>
					<p>Atomies avoid most serious-minded creatures, but mix freely with grigs, and are 20% likely to be found in their company. The lightest and quickest of all the sprites, atomies are less than 1-foot tall. Atomies have four dragonfly-like wings. Their features are elven, their skin is pale with a hint of woodland green. Atomie clothing is innately magical, bright and festive while at the same time blending with woodland surroundings.</p>
					<p>Atomies have twice the hearing range of humans, and they have infravision to 90 feet. Their voices are high-pitched, almost a bee-like buzz. Atomies speak their own language and often the languages of sprites, pixies, and some broken Common. They can also speak with plants and animals.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Atomies attack as 3rd-level fighters. About 20% of atomies carry tiny crossbows and spears. Atomie crossbows have a 3-foot range and inflict <b>1d3 points of damage </b>. Atomie spears cause <b>1d4 points of damage </b>. The remaining atomies are armed with either spears (40%) or sprite swords (40%). Atomies have the following magical abilities, usable once per round at 5th-level ability: <i>blink </i>, <i>invisibility </i>, <i>pass plant </i>, <i>speak with animals </i>, and <i>summon insects </i>.</p>
					<p>Atomies are surprised only on a 1; opponents suffer a -6 penalty to surprise rolls. Upon hearing an intruder, atomies hide and try to make the intruder go away, using false lights, clattering voices, and pesky, summoned insects. Repeat intruders are warned with crossbow bolts. If combat is inevitable, or the intruders are orcs, the atomies regroup and attack. Atomies with spears fly in and dive on surprised opponents (usually aiming at their posteriors). Diving attacks inflict double damage (2d4).</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Atomies live in the upper branches of old hardwood trees (usually oaks), one family per tree. Each family hollows out a series of tiny rooms, decorating with walnut chairs, woven pine needle rugs, acorn dishes, and the like. A network of balconies, landings, and rope bridges connects the dwellings, forming a village high above the forest floor. A typical atomie village houses 3d4x10 adults and 4d6 children.</p>
					<p>Atomies seldom bother with outsiders, even standard sprites (whom they view as tedious and too serious), but they will sometimes help a lost child. A rescued child is well cared for and entertained before being returned to the outside world.</p>
					<p>The concept of pets is unknown, but atomies often grow mushroom 'friends' in their living rooms.</p>
					<p>Atomies have loose leadership, choosing a chieftain based on storytelling and singing ability.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Atomies are herbivores and find the eating habits of their cousins repulsive. They favor nuts above fruit, and prefer honey when they can trick bees into giving them some.</p>
					<p>Atomies make a perfect, bite-sized morsels for most creatures, and sometimes fall prey to evil animals, such as worgs.</p>
					<p>Atomies view magic as a force connected with life and are fascinated by inanimate magical items. Atomies collect magical items and display them in their homes or communities. Non-magical treasures are considered clutter and are either thrown away or given to forest creatures who value such things.</p>
					<p><b>Grigs</b></p>
					<p>Grigs are mischievous and lighthearted. They have no fear of big people and take great joy in playing tricks upon them.</p>
					<p>A grig has the head, torso, and arms of a sprite, with the wings, antennae, and legs of a cricket. They can leap great distances. Grigs have light blue skin, forest green hair, and brown hairy legs. They usually wear tunics or brightly colored vests with buttons made from tiny gems. Grigs speak atomie, brownie, pixie, sprite, and Common. They have double normal hearing range and 180-foot infravision. The origin of the grigs remains a mystery.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Fierce (by sprite standards), each grig carries six small darts and a sprite sword. Grigs gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls with darts. Darts and swords do normal damage when used by grigs, but only 1 point of damage when used by non-grigs.</p>
					<p>Grigs have the following spell-like abilities, usable once per round at 6th-level ability: <i>change self </i>, <i>entangle </i>, <i>invisibility </i>, <i>pyrotechnics </i>, <i>trip </i>, and <i>ventriloquism </i>. Grigs move silently in woodlands; they are surprised only on a 1, while opponents suffer a -6 penalty to surprise rolls. Some grigs throw darts, while others leap to attack, and one grig fiddler (grigs never go anywhere without a fiddle), plays a song with the same effect as <i>Otto's irresistible dance </i>. <b><u>All non-sprites within 30 feet of the fiddler must make a successful saving throw vs. spell or dance until the grig ceases playing </u></b>. Grigs can play for hours.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Grigs roam the forests in small bands. They have no permanent homes but often sleep in the limbs of treants, or near unicorns (who protect grigs even unto death).</p>
					<p>Grigs are cautious but trusting. They delight in playing pranks on big people. Common ploys include stealing food, collapsing a tent, and using <i>ventriloquism </i>to make objects talk. Once a prank is set, the grigs sit back and watch, laughing at the unfortunate person. People who make fools of themselves are apt to be plagued by harmless jokes until they reach the forest edge. At that point, one of the grigs comes out of hiding and makes amends with a gift, either a harmless bauble such as a 1d6x100 gp gem (25%) or a precious jar of really fresh honey (75%).</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Grigs live on nuts, berries and honey, like their atomie cousins.</p>

					<p>Sprites are shy and reclusive faerie people, related to other faerie-folk, like brownies and leprechauns. There are several varieties, including pixies and nixies. Most have small, semitransparent wings, and elven features. Normal sprites have distinctly elven features and live in meadows and wooded glens. The wingless sea sprites make their homes on colorful coral reefs, living in harmony with the sea creatures, protecting the reefs' delicate environment, and frolicking in the waves. The naturally invisible pixies are perhaps the most intelligent and mischievous of the faeries; they dwell in idyllic woodlands and delight in harassing travelers with their pranks. Nixies are water sprites that live in freshwater lakes, and, while they harbor no grudges against humankind, they delight in enslaving men as their beasts of burden. Other sylvan creatures related to sprites include the swift atomies and the mischievous grigs, both forest-dwellers.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Sprites hate evil and ugliness, and are capable of stout militancy, should their secluded homes be invaded by orcs or worse. They fight with long, slim swords which do damage as a human-sized dagger, or their own special bows. Bows have a range half that of a human short bow and do only half as much damage (1-3 points). The tips of their arrows are coated with a special ointment concocted by the sprites. <b><u>Any creature struck by the drugged arrows, regardless of level, race, or magic resistance, must make a saving throw vs. poison or fall into a deep sleep lasting 1d6 hours </u></b>. Normally sprites do nothing more than take their victims to safe a place very far away (often confiscating their weapons in the process), though evil creatures may be slain.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Sprites prefer to avoid other intelligent beings and live in places where they can have many celebrations, parties, and gatherings. They gather on most moonlit nights for singing and dancing, land sprites in the glens, and water sprites in the surf. Land sprites live in sylvan woodlands, they monitor and protect forests and secluded glens. Water sprites protect their watery territories equally well.</p>
					<p>Most land-dwelling species of sprite are immortal, and never die unless killed. The sprites' diminutive size and their dangerous environments keep sprite populations low.</p>
					<p><b>Sprite (standard)</b></p>
					<p>Sprites usually speak only their own language, common, and elven, but seem to get along with woodland mammals and other creatures anyway. Humans often mistake sprites for butterflies at a distance, and it is guessed that the majority of forest creatures also think of the fair sprites in this way.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Sprites can become <i>invisible </i>at will and <i>detect good/evil </i>within 50 yards, so they are hard to deceive, evade, or capture. When invisible, sprites get +2 to attack rolls against opponents, who suffer a -4 penalty to hit the sprites.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Sprites are very flighty, and find even elves much too serious about most woodland affairs. Only druids deal with sprites regularly. Some druids even receive a little of their training in the company of a few sprites. Most sprites love druids, for their neutral alignment and love for nature make them see the forest in much the same way. On rare occasions, sprites associate with rangers as well.</p>
					<p>Sprites are loosely tribal, electing the best warrior among the group (male or female) as the group spokesperson. This leader is recognized as the one who makes major decisions and bargains with druids and elves. Sprites rarely wait for their leader's decision, often attacking an evil creature before the leader can issue any command.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Sprite sleep ointment is concocted from forest mushrooms. The ointment must be left to cure in the sun for seven days. Sprites hollow out tree stumps to serve as containers for this rare substance.</p>
					<p>Sprites keep watch on their fellow sprites, so they know who to invite to their frequent gatherings. A deserted meadow or glen is never empty for more than a decade before a new clan of sprites moves in.</p>
					<p><b>Sea Sprites</b></p>
					<p>Sea sprites have fine, cheerful faces, with rounded cheeks and wide, fish-like eyes. Their hair is the color and texture of seaweed, and reaches down to the gills on their necks, which enable sea sprites to breathe water as well as air. Their skin is light blue, smooth, and slick. Sea sprites have no wings, but webbing grows between their toes and fingers. Sea sprites wear bright, eelskin jerkins, and often adorn themselves with ornaments crafted from treasures found in the ocean.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>About half of the sea sprites encountered carry special crossbows. In the hands of sea sprites, these crossbows function like light crossbows above and below water. Sea sprites coat their crossbow bolts in sprite sleep ointment.</p>
					<p>Sea sprites hate and fear sahuagin, and kill those they put to sleep. Air breathers are left on a nearby beach provided they have neither harmed nor attempted to harm the coral reef.</p>
					<p>Sea sprites can turn <i>invisible </i>at will and <i>detect good/evil </i>within 50 yards. Three times per day, a sea sprite may cast <i>slow </i>, by touch, at the 5th level of ability. Once per day, a sea sprite can cast <i>airy water </i>as a 10th-level spellcaster.</p>
					<p>Sea sprites are 45% likely to be accompanied by ld6 large carnivorous fish, such as barracudas. These fish act as guards and pets, attacking any creature that threatens the sprites.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Sea sprites live in natural caves in coral reefs, or amid large wrecks. Though sea sprites can breathe air, they rarely set foot on land. Their homes are cheerfully decorated with a mishmash of seashells, bones, pearls, free-swimming and colorful pet fish, and artifacts taken from sunken ships. Sea sprites live in small communities of four or five families.While each community is led by the eldest male, the true power often rests in the hands of his mate.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Sea sprites eat seaweeds, small crustaceans, and fish. They raise fish and never deplete the reefs where they live. The only natural enemies of sea sprites are sahuagin. Sea sprites usually live for several centuries. They sometimes trade with sea elves but never mix socially with them.</p>
					<p><b>Pixie</b></p>
					<p>Pixies stand about 2 1/2 feet tall. When visible, they resemble small elves, but with longer ears. Pixies have two silver wings, like those of moths. They wear bright clothing, often with a cap and a pair of shoes with curled and pointed toes. Pixies speak their own language, Common, and the language of sprites.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Pixies carry sprite-sized swords and bows. They use three types of arrows, and shoot them with a +4 bonus to the attack roll. Besides standard sprite sleep-arrows, pixies use a war arrow, which inflicts <b>1d4+1 points of damage </b>, and an arrow which does no physical harm to the target. <b><u>Those hit by this arrow must make a successful saving throw vs. spell, or suffer complete loss of memory which can be restored only by a </u></b><b><i><u>heal </u></i></b><b><u>or a </u></b><b><i><u>limited wish </u></i></b>.</p>
					<p>Pixies can, once per day, use each of the following magical powers, as if they were 8th-level mages: <i>polymorph self </i>, <i>know alignment </i>, <i>dispel magic </i>, <i>dancing lights </i>, and <i>ESP </i>. They can also do the following once per day: become visible for as long as they desire; create illusions with both audial and visual components; and cause <i>confusion </i>by touch. Their illusions require no concentration and last until magically dispelled. <b><u>A creature attacked with confusion must make a successful saving throw vs. spell, or suffer its effects until a </u></b><b><i><u>remove curse </u></i></b><b><u>is applied </u></b>. One pixie in 10 can use Otto's <i>irresistible dance </i>, also once per day.</p>
					<p>Because pixies are normally invisible, opponents suffer a -4 penalty to attack rolls. A successful <i>dispel magic </i>against 8th-level magic makes any pixies, in its area of effect, visible for one round, then they automatically become invisible again. They attack while invisible without penalty.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Pixies live in deep forest caves, dancing in moonlit glades to the music of crickets and frogs. They are pranksters and they love to lead travelers astray. They use their illusion powers to accomplish this, hence the expression 'pixie-led' for one who has lost his way. They like to frighten maidens, rap on walls, blow out candles, and play in water.</p>
					<p>Pixies love to trick misers into giving away their treasure, especially by convincing them that something horrible will happen to them if they do not. Pixies carry no treasure, but sometimes have a hoard in their lair to impress visitors. Pixies use treasure to taunt greedy people, and then play merciless pranks on them until they abandon their search for the pixies' fortune. If the victim shows no greed and exhibits a good sense of humor about their pranks, the pixies may allow that individual to choose one item from their hoard.</p>
					<p>Pixies dwell together in a community of clans or families that seem to mimic human customs. Each family has a last name, and family and community loyalty is very important to pixies. Their life span is about 300 years.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Pixies eat fruits and nectar. The most famous by-product of pixies is pixie dust, also known as <i>dust of disappearance </i>. Crushing 50 pixie wings into a fine powder creates one dose of <i>dust of disappearance </i>. Naturally, pixies frown on this use of their wings.</p>
					<p><b>Nixie</b></p>
					<p>Nixies have webbed fingers and toes, pointed ears, and wide silver eyes. Most are slim and comely, and they have lightly scaled, pale green skin and dark green hair. Females are attractive, often twining shells and pearl strings in their thick hair, and they modestly dress in tight-fitting wraps woven from colorful seaweeds.</p>
					<p>Males wear loincloths of the same materials. Nixies can breathe both water and air; travel on land is possible, but they prefer not to leave their lakes. Nixies speak their own language and the Common tongue.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>If one or more humans approach within 30 feet of a group of nixies, the nixies pool their magic to create a powerful <i>charm </i>spell, one such spell per every 10 nixies. <b><u>The victim must make a saving throw vs. spell at -2 on the die roll </u></b>. Before a <i>charmed </i>humans enters the water, there is a 75% chance that a <i>dispel magic </i>will break the charm. Once the victim is in the water, the chance of <i>dispelling </i>the magic drops to 10%.</p>
					<p>Nixies keep each <i>charmed </i>slave for one full year, forcing him to do all their heavy labor, but thereafter the <i>charm </i>wears off and the victim is set free. During this enslavement, the nixies keep a <i>water breathing </i>spell on the human captive. Nixies can cast this spell on any creature, or dispel it, once per day; the spell's duration is one day.</p>
					<p>Male nixies carry daggers and javelins. The javelins are used to spear things in the water, or can be thrown. A group of 10 nixies can use a large fishing net against adversaries who are in the water with them. Nixies make one net attack against AC 10 to ensnare a single man-sized creature, -2 AC for each additional victim, up to five total victims (and AC 0). Nixies sometimes employ guardian fish in battle.</p>
					<p>Even with 25% magic resistance, nixies fear fire and very bright lights, so a <i>flaming sword </i>or a <i>light </i>spell keeps them at bay. Nixies try to negate a <i>continual light </i>spell by summoning small fish to crowd around the light and dim it.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Nixie dwellings are woven from living seaweed and difficult to detect (5% chance within 20 feet, impossible from farther away). Nixies keep giant fish as guards, either 1-2 gar (20%) or 2-5 pike (80%); these are taught to obey simple commands. Small bright, ornamental fish are kept as pets and trained to perform elaborate tricks. Trout, bass, and catfish are herded as food. Nixies can also summon 10-100 small fish, which takes 1-3 rounds.</p>
					<p>Nixie tribes have 20-80 members, about one third are youth. Families have 4-8 members, and the tribe usually includes 10-15 families, all related through common ancestors. A nixie tribe controls an area with a radius of 3-5 miles; when a tribe gets too large, 2-3 families split off to form a new tribe. Nixies live for several centuries.</p>
					<p>Nixie tribes are ruled by the Acquar (water mother), a hereditary position held by a direct descendant of the original founding ancestor. She decides major disputes and chooses the most apt warrior to be the S'oquar, the warlord responsible for hunting and defense. The Acquar is advised by a council of elders, whose spokesperson is called the L'uquar, the keeper of the tribe's oral history. Treasures, whether the spoils of war or the results of work or luck, are divided equally by the Acquar. Intertribal rivalries are often fierce, and females are sometimes kidnapped as brides, for nixies are polygamists, keeping 2-3 wives. Nixies worship water and nature powers.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Lakes with nixie tribes are kept clean and well stocked; often, human slaves work to improve the environment through the removal of trash and obstructions. Nixie artifacts include jewelry of shells, pearls and opals, silk from water spiders, and <i>potions of water breathing </i>.</p>
					<p><b>Atomie</b></p>
					<p>Atomies avoid most serious-minded creatures, but mix freely with grigs, and are 20% likely to be found in their company. The lightest and quickest of all the sprites, atomies are less than 1-foot tall. Atomies have four dragonfly-like wings. Their features are elven, their skin is pale with a hint of woodland green. Atomie clothing is innately magical, bright and festive while at the same time blending with woodland surroundings.</p>
					<p>Atomies have twice the hearing range of humans, and they have infravision to 90 feet. Their voices are high-pitched, almost a bee-like buzz. Atomies speak their own language and often the languages of sprites, pixies, and some broken Common. They can also speak with plants and animals.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Atomies attack as 3rd-level fighters. About 20% of atomies carry tiny crossbows and spears. Atomie crossbows have a 3-foot range and inflict <b>1d3 points of damage </b>. Atomie spears cause <b>1d4 points of damage </b>. The remaining atomies are armed with either spears (40%) or sprite swords (40%). Atomies have the following magical abilities, usable once per round at 5th-level ability: <i>blink </i>, <i>invisibility </i>, <i>pass plant </i>, <i>speak with animals </i>, and <i>summon insects </i>.</p>
					<p>Atomies are surprised only on a 1; opponents suffer a -6 penalty to surprise rolls. Upon hearing an intruder, atomies hide and try to make the intruder go away, using false lights, clattering voices, and pesky, summoned insects. Repeat intruders are warned with crossbow bolts. If combat is inevitable, or the intruders are orcs, the atomies regroup and attack. Atomies with spears fly in and dive on surprised opponents (usually aiming at their posteriors). Diving attacks inflict double damage (2d4).</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Atomies live in the upper branches of old hardwood trees (usually oaks), one family per tree. Each family hollows out a series of tiny rooms, decorating with walnut chairs, woven pine needle rugs, acorn dishes, and the like. A network of balconies, landings, and rope bridges connects the dwellings, forming a village high above the forest floor. A typical atomie village houses 3d4x10 adults and 4d6 children.</p>
					<p>Atomies seldom bother with outsiders, even standard sprites (whom they view as tedious and too serious), but they will sometimes help a lost child. A rescued child is well cared for and entertained before being returned to the outside world.</p>
					<p>The concept of pets is unknown, but atomies often grow mushroom 'friends' in their living rooms.</p>
					<p>Atomies have loose leadership, choosing a chieftain based on storytelling and singing ability.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Atomies are herbivores and find the eating habits of their cousins repulsive. They favor nuts above fruit, and prefer honey when they can trick bees into giving them some.</p>
					<p>Atomies make a perfect, bite-sized morsels for most creatures, and sometimes fall prey to evil animals, such as worgs.</p>
					<p>Atomies view magic as a force connected with life and are fascinated by inanimate magical items. Atomies collect magical items and display them in their homes or communities. Non-magical treasures are considered clutter and are either thrown away or given to forest creatures who value such things.</p>
					<p><b>Grigs</b></p>
					<p>Grigs are mischievous and lighthearted. They have no fear of big people and take great joy in playing tricks upon them.</p>
					<p>A grig has the head, torso, and arms of a sprite, with the wings, antennae, and legs of a cricket. They can leap great distances. Grigs have light blue skin, forest green hair, and brown hairy legs. They usually wear tunics or brightly colored vests with buttons made from tiny gems. Grigs speak atomie, brownie, pixie, sprite, and Common. They have double normal hearing range and 180-foot infravision. The origin of the grigs remains a mystery.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Fierce (by sprite standards), each grig carries six small darts and a sprite sword. Grigs gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls with darts. Darts and swords do normal damage when used by grigs, but only 1 point of damage when used by non-grigs.</p>
					<p>Grigs have the following spell-like abilities, usable once per round at 6th-level ability: <i>change self </i>, <i>entangle </i>, <i>invisibility </i>, <i>pyrotechnics </i>, <i>trip </i>, and <i>ventriloquism </i>. Grigs move silently in woodlands; they are surprised only on a 1, while opponents suffer a -6 penalty to surprise rolls. Some grigs throw darts, while others leap to attack, and one grig fiddler (grigs never go anywhere without a fiddle), plays a song with the same effect as <i>Otto's irresistible dance </i>. <b><u>All non-sprites within 30 feet of the fiddler must make a successful saving throw vs. spell or dance until the grig ceases playing </u></b>. Grigs can play for hours.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Grigs roam the forests in small bands. They have no permanent homes but often sleep in the limbs of treants, or near unicorns (who protect grigs even unto death).</p>
					<p>Grigs are cautious but trusting. They delight in playing pranks on big people. Common ploys include stealing food, collapsing a tent, and using <i>ventriloquism </i>to make objects talk. Once a prank is set, the grigs sit back and watch, laughing at the unfortunate person. People who make fools of themselves are apt to be plagued by harmless jokes until they reach the forest edge. At that point, one of the grigs comes out of hiding and makes amends with a gift, either a harmless bauble such as a 1d6x100 gp gem (25%) or a precious jar of really fresh honey (75%).</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Grigs live on nuts, berries and honey, like their atomie cousins.</p>

					<p>Giant squids are huge varieties of the normal, peaceful, tentacled cephalopods (unshelled invertebrates).</p>
					<p>They have ten long tentacles, two of which are always used to maintain stability when attacking or defending, and long, protected heads with two eyes. Their beak-like mouths are located where the tentacles meet the lower portion of their bodies.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Giant squids prefer to grab their opponents in their tentacles and constrict them, while they bring the thrashing victims into their huge jaws. As many as eight tentacles can attack one opponent, but only one at a time can constrict a man-sized opponent (the rest are free to attack anything else within reach). The rubbery tentacles are so strong they cannot be broken by force and must be severed. A giant squid's tentacles hit for <b>1d6 points of damage </b>and constrict for <b>2d6 points of damage </b>every round after the initial strike. The beak of a giant squid inflicts <b>5d4 points of damage </b>.</p>
					<p>Any character who is constricted may have one arm (01-25% left, or 26-50% right), no arms (51-75%), or both arms (76-100%) pinned. A constricted character cannot cast any spells, but he can grab a weapon and attack the tentacle (if only one arm is free, he attacks with a -3 penalty to the attack roll; if both arms are free, the penalty is -1). A giant squid's tentacle requires 12 points of damage from sharp or edged weapons to sever (these hit points are in addition to the hit points from Hit Dice).</p>
					<p>If a giant squid has four or more tentacles severed, the monster is 80% likely to squirt out a cloud of jet-black ink 60 feet high by 60 feet wide and 80 feet long. The squid then jets away and retreats to its lair. The ink completely obscures the vision of all within the cloud.</p>
					<p>A giant squid can drag ships of small size to the bottom and can halt the movement of larger ones in one turn of dragging. After six or more tentacles have squeezed the hull of the ship for three consecutive rounds, the vessel suffers damage as if it had been rammed and it begins to take on water and sink.</p>
					<p><b>Kraken</b></p>
					<p>A kraken is a rare form of gargantuan squid. It is one of the most deadly monsters in existence.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Krakens attack as huge varieties of giant squid. Two of their tentacles are barbed and cause <b>3d6 points of damage </b>when they hit. They then try to drag prey toward their gaping maws for a bite of <b>7d4 points of damage </b>. The other six free tentacles inflict <b>2d6 points of damage </b>when they hit and constrict for 3d6 points each round thereafter. A kraken's tentacle must suffer 18 points of damage from sharp or edged weapons to be severed (these hit points are in addition to those the kraken gets from its Hit Dice).</p>
					<p>If three of more of its tentacles have been severed, the monster is 80% likely to retreat, leaving behind a cloud of ink to discourage pursuit. The kraken is 50% likely to retreat to its den if four or more of its tentacles have victims. It leaves behind an ink cloud in this case also. The ink cloud of a kraken is 80 feet high by 80 feet wide by 120 feet long and is poisonous (it dissipates in 2-5 rounds). Those within the cloud receive <b>2d4 points of damage </b>every round they remain. Krakens jet away to their lairs at a movement rate 21.</p>
					<p>Krakens can drag ships of 60 feet long down in the same way as normal giant squids attack. They have the innate power to cause <i>airy water </i>in a sphere 120 yards across or in a hemisphere 240 yards across (they can do this continuously). They can employ the following spell-like powers, one at a time, at will: <i>faerie fire </i>for up to eight hours, <i>control temperature </i>in a 40-yard radius continuously, <i>control winds </i>once per day, <i>weather summoning </i>once per day, and <i>animal summoning III </i>(fish only) three times per day (note that this spell does not grant control of the fish once summoned).</p>
					<p>Krakens are not affected by the conch horns of tritons.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Krakens have Intelligences of genius or higher and often control entire regions of the underwater world. Their lairs lie thousands of feet below the surface and they maintain huge complexes of caverns where they keep and breed human slaves to serve and feed them.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Krakens can breathe either air or water and are aggressive hunters. Many tropical islands have been completely stripped of all inhabitants (animal and human) by krakens.</p>
					<p>It is said that krakens retreated to the depths when the forces of good thwarted their attempt to rule the seas, but is also said that in the future krakens will rise again.</p>

					<p>Stirges are bird-like creatures that drink the blood of their victims for sustenance. They have four small, pincer-like legs that they use to clamp onto the necks of their victims. They are rusty-red to reddish brown in color, and their eyes and feet are yellowish. The dangling proboscises of stirges are pink at the tip, fading to gray at the base (near their heads).</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Due to an instinctive ability to find and attack weak points, stirges attack as 4-Hit Die creatures, rather than 1+1. Their long proboscis inflicts <b>1-3 points of damage </b>when it hits, and drains 1d4 points of blood every round thereafter. When a stirge drains a total of 12 points of blood from a victim, it becomes bloated and flies off to digest its protein-rich meal.</p>
					<p>Stirges must be killed to be removed, due to their strong grip. If an attack against an attached stirge misses, make another attack roll against the victim's Armor Class to see if the attack hits the victim instead. Caution is advisable when attempting to remove an attached stirge.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Stirges form nest-like colonies in attics, dungeons, and copses of trees. Although they resemble birds, they hang upside down when sleeping, indicating that stirges may be closely related to vampire bats.</p>
					<p>Stirges can breed in captivity, but a constant supply of blood is needed. Stirges mostly kill low-level humans, animals and children, so the arrival of these predators in any civilized territory is always a cause for alarm. Fortunately, even a low-level group of adventurers or town militia is usually capable of ending the menace with little or no loss of life.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Stirges have an acute sense of smell, can see in the dark, and can sense heat sources within 200 feet. These senses keep stirges informed when living creatures enter their habitat. Creatures with a natural AC of 3 or better are usually <b><u>immune to a stirge's blood draining attack, since their hides are too thick to penetrate </u></b>. As a consequence, huge nests of stirges live symbiotically with some evil dragons.</p>
					<p>Characters who protect their entire bodies with special leather or better armor (this special armor costs two to three times more than normal armor) can safely approach a stirge. Even the slightest gap in the protection is seen and smelled by the creature, and a successful attack roll means the creature has broken through the weakness and locked on.</p>
					<p>After a stirge has gorged itself by draining blood, it sleeps for one day, plus one day for every 2 points of blood it drank (the maximum sleep period is after drinking 12 points of blood - seven days). During this period of rest, silent attackers can impose a -2 penalty to the stirges' surprise roll, as the beasts wake slowly and remain drowsy for a few moments. They are most vulnerable at this time. While certain species of stirges prefer to dine on human blood, most are content with any large mammal, like cows, moose, and deer. Experienced druids and rangers usually recognize the traces of a stirge colony by the occurrences of mysteriously drained and dead animals in the vicinity.</p>
					<p>A stirge colony's territory extends for only a mile in diameter, so stirges move around a lot after they've drained a region of the available blood. Often, the presence of stirges is only discovered long after the colony has departed, making it very difficult to track them.</p>
					<p><b>Jungle Stirges</b></p>
					<p>There are rumored to be exceptionally large varieties of stirges deep in the densest tropical jungles. Though they are only 2+2 Hit Die creatures, they attack as 8 Hit Die monsters. Purportedly, they have a paralyzing poison in the tips of their sharp snouts that is highly prized by local tribesmen. Jungle stirges have been known to mingle with giant vampire bats. None of these larger versions have ever been captured or examined by sages, so nothing else is known about their strengths or weaknesses. What little of them is known came from the cannibals and head hunters of the jungle regions.</p>

					<p>Babaus are greater tanar'ri that roam the layers of the Abyss recruiting lesser and least tanar'ri for the vast armies of the Blood War. They look like tall skeletons covered with dark, form-fitting leather. A great horn protrudes from the back of their skulls. Babaus have long, wicked claws covered with dirt, blood, and decaying flesh. Their movements are very quick, sharp, and mechanical, emphasizing their alien nature.</p>
					<p>Babaus communicate using telepathy.</p>
					<p><b><u></u></b></p>
					<p></p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p><b><u>Any creature who meets a babau's glowing red gaze must save vs. spells or be affected as by a </u></b><b><i><u>ray of enfeeblement </u></i></b>. Gaze range is 20'. The gaze affects one opponent per round, in addition to normal attacks. Babaus are immune from attacks by nonmagical weapons.</p>
					<p>Babaus can use any weapon they find. They have enchanted and magical weapons 20% of the time (determine magical weapon randomly). Babaus have Strength 19 and gain a +7 damage bonus.</p>
					<p>Babaus attack with two claws ( <b>1d4+1 damage </b>each) and their sharp horn ( <b>2d4 damage </b>). Babaus are intelligent and prefer other means of attack, but they fight fiercely unarmed when necessary.</p>
					<p>Babaus generate a slick, dark red substance that covers their bodies. This slippery jelly halves damage from all slashing and piercing weapons (type S and P), and it has a corrosive quality. It has a 20% chance per hit of corroding a metal weapon. <b><u>Normal metal weapons must save vs. acid with each hit or corrode and become useless </u></b>. Magical metal weapons lose one 'plus'. Further, if the liquid comes into contact with exposed flesh (during grappling attacks or other contact), it burns for 1d6 of acid damage.</p>
					<p>In addition to those available to all tanar'ri, babaus have the spell-like powers <i>dispel magic </i>, <i>fear </i>, <i>fly </i>, <i>heat metal </i>, <i>levitate </i>, and <i>polymorph self </i>. Once a day they can attempt to <i>gate </i>in 1-6 cambions or 1 babau with a 40% chance of success. There is also a chance that a true tanar'ri comes to the aid of a babau in trouble (see below).</p>
					<p>Babaus have the abilities of a 9th-level thief (pick pockets 30%, open locks 30%, find/remove traps 25%, move silently 95%, hide in shadows 80%, detect noise 35%, climb walls 90%, read languages 30%, backstab (x4)).</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Other tanar'ri hate babaus because they roam around recruiting for the vast Abyss armies. To escape service, numbers of lesser tanar'ri sometimes gang up on a pursuing babau and try to kill it. However, the babau defend themselves well.</p>
					<p>True tanar'ri have close ties with babaus. If a babau is attacked, a true tanar'ri (randomly determined) is 20% likely to notice and come to its aid - not through any sense of loyalty, but rather to further the Blood War. This causes the lesser tanar'ri to fear babaus even more.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>According to the true tanar'ri (presumably among the greatest powers of the Abyss), the only purpose of the lesser and least tanar'ri is to fight in the Blood War. Because the babaus are the grim recruiters of those armies, they are integral to the Abyss and important in the Blood War.</p>

					<p>Petty and wicked, dretches are the most common tanar'ri, found in massive hordes everywhere in the Abyss. Along with the manes, the dretches are the rank-and-file of the Blood War.</p>
					<p>Dretches are gaunt, squat humanoids with rubbery, almost hairless bodies. Their skin is pale white to beige, giving way to sickly blue in some areas, stretched over pulsing varicose veins. Dretches' mouths are slack and slobbery with many small fangs. Their hair is sparse and bristly, exposing pointed ears that hang limply from either side of the head. A dretch's eyes slant downward and the nose appears squashed.</p>
					<p>Dretches communicate using telepathy.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Only their vast numbers allow dretches to survive the rigors of the Abyss. These creatures will not flee combat if a greater or true tanar'ri is present. Dretches are so wretched they would rather die than fall further into disfavor by fleeing. Their natural attack form consists of a claw/claw/bite routine (1d4/1d4/1d4+1).</p>
					<p>In addition to those available to all tanar'ri, dretches can use these spell-like abilities: <i>scare </i>, <i>stinking cloud </i>(once per day), and <i>telekinesis </i>. Once per day, they can attempt to <i>gate </i>in 1-4 dretches with a 50% chance of success. They like to gate in companions, then have the companions immediately attempt gates in turn, and so on until a vast horde of dretches appears.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Dretcbes are the lowest form of actual tanar'ri; their inferiors, the manes, are merely dead spirits from the Prime Material Plane. Dretches mill around and torment the manes to avoid considering their own lowly position.</p>
					<p>Some dretches try to be extremely useful, hoping for promotion. Others consider themselves so lowly that they have nothing to lose, and they rebel. By virtue of their numbers, they feel they can go their own way and ignore the more powerful tanar'ri. This leads to a huge slaughter of the rebellious dretches by more powerful tanar'ri. These civil outbreaks temporarily divert the tanar'ri from the Blood War, sometimes with disastrous results.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Dretches are important to the Blood War. The primary strength of the tanar'ri is their sheer numbers, and those numbers consist largely of dretches. Unlike the hordlings, they are actual tanar'ri and have concern for their position. This makes them more reliable than hordlings, if the term applies to any creature in the Abyss.</p>
					<p>The dretches' weakness makes them a perfect choice for food in an environment where food is scarce. Greater fiends eat them in great quantities.</p>

					<p>Beautiful and seductive, the succubi are the temptresses of mortals. Whereas the glabrezu tempt men of power, the succubi choose men of passion and energy.Succubi appear most often <i>polymorphed </i>into stunningly beautiful women with perfect figures and smooth, milky skin. They may also appear as any demihuman race. However, they do not often deal with demihumans, because humans' fiery nature makes them easier prey.</p>
					<p>Succubi look more tanar'ric in their true form: that of a beautiful woman with large wings and sinister, glowing eyes.</p>
					<p>Succubi can speak the language of their victims. They also communicate using telepathy.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Succubi are never surprised. They are not warriors. When pressed, they defend themselves, but flee when possible. When trapped, they can attack with two fists ( <b>1d3 damage </b>each).</p>
					<p>Succubi are affected only by <b><u>+2 or better weapons </u></b>. They are <b><u>immune to all fire-based attacks, magical or otherwise </u></b>.</p>
					<p>The kiss of a succubus drains energy from its victim, causing the loss of one level of life energy. The succubus lures a mortal man into activities of passion and then drains energy from him. Even after a drain, the heat of the moment is so strong that most men do not notice (Wisdom check at -4 penalty to notice each drain). If he fails the check, he continues, heedless of danger.</p>
					<p>In addition to those available to all tanar'ri, succubi also have the following spell-like powers: <i>become ethereal </i>(as if using <i>oil of etherealness </i>), <i>charm person </i>, <i>clairaudience </i>, <i>ESP </i>, <i>plane shift </i>, <i>shapechange </i>(to a humanoid form of about their own height and weight), and <i>suggestion </i>. They can also attempt to <i>gate </i>in 1 balor once per day with a 40% chance of success.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>The temptresses of the Lower Planes are subtle and slow. They seduce mortals with their charms, ultimately killing them and taking their life forces to the Abyss.</p>
					<p>Succubi act independently of tanar'ri society. They work of their own volition and ultimately answer to no one. The greater and true tanar'ri seem content with this situation.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>The destruction of mortals increases the power of the Abyss. With this power the succubi aid the eternal war effort of the tanar'ri, who therefore tolerate them.</p>
					<p><b>Incubus</b></p>
					<p>lncubi are the male counterparts to succubi, but they are far less common. These creatures travel to the Prime Material Plane to tempt female mortals. These creatures always appear as the most perfect male specimen of whatever race they are tempting. However, succubi and incubi do not mate to perpetuate their kind.</p>
					<p>It is uncertain why there are more succubi than incubi. Sages suggest that mortal men are far more susceptible to the temptations of beauty than are women.</p>

					<p>Greatest and most terrible of the true tanar'ri, the balors are the undisputed terrors of the Abyss. They motivate the tanar'ri involvement in the Blood War and derive immense pleasure from others' suffering.</p>
					<p>Balors are repulsive, towering humanoids with dark red skin; huge wings that propel them with unnatural speed and agility; long, wicked claws; and grotesque fangs that drip venom. Each balor carries a sword of lightning and a many-tailed whip, and searing flames surround the creature.</p>
					<p>Balors communicate using telepathy.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Balors are cannot be surprised. They are <b><u>immune to all nonmagical attacks including fire, gas, poison, and weapons, and all attacks with magical weapons of less than +3 enchantment </u></b>.</p>
					<p>Balors prefer their primary weapon, a <i>vorpal sword </i>that looks like a bolt of lightning and can <i>detect evil/good </i>in a 30' radius. <b><u>Any creature picking up a balor's sword suffers 10d6 damage </u></b><u>and must save vs. spell or die </u>.</p>
					<p>Balors also use a long whip with many tails ( <b>1d4 damage </b>). These magically wrap around the victim, who is drawn into the balor's bodily flames ( <b>4d6 damage </b>per round). Escaping the whip requires a successful check against half the victim's Strength score. A whip that holds a victim cannot be used in attacks.</p>
					<p><b><u>Balors can also attack with their fists ( 2d6 damage </u></b><u>and save vs. spell at -6 or flee in terror for 1-6 turns) </u>. <b><u>If slain in the Abyss, a balor explodes in a blinding flash of light, inflicting 50 hp damage to everything in a 100'radius (save vs. spell for half damage) </u></b>.</p>
					<p>In addition to those available to all tanar'ri, balors can use the following spell-like powers at 20th level of spell use: <i>detect invisibility </i>(always active), <i>detect magic </i>(always active), <i>dispel magic </i>, <i>fear </i>, <i>pyrotechnics </i>, <i>read magic </i>, <i>suggestion </i>, <i>symbol </i>(any type), <i>telekinesis </i>, and <i>tongues </i>. Once per hour they can automatically <i>gate </i>in 1-8 least, 1-6 lesser, 1-4 greater, or 1 true tanar'ri.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>At least twenty-four balors are known to exist. They wander the Abyss, forming armies and commanding them in battle with the baatezu.</p>
					<p>Balors recognize all planes as potential battlegrounds in the War. They make pacts with mortals to perform services in return for power in the mortals' planes. The more followers or allies they gain there, the more magical power they command in the Blood War.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Nothing is more important in the Abyss than the Blood War. The balor, in a sense, are the Blood War from a tanar'ri perspective. In that sense they are the ecology of the Abyss, driving the creation of new beings and mandating their survival.</p>

They have dog-like heads with sharp fangs and penetrating violet eyes. Their skin color ranges from a deep russet to pitch black. These commanding tanar'ri are terrifying to see.</p>
					<p>Glabrezu communicate using telepathy.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Glabrezu usually avoid combat with mortals, preferring guile, trickery, and evil bargains. However, if things do not go as planned, the glabrezu thinks nothing of slaying the mortal (who, to the glabrezu's thinking, will probably end up in the Abyss anyway).</p>
					<p>A glabrezu can attack with two claws ( <b>1d3 damage </b>each), two pincers ( <b>2d6 damage </b>each), and a bite ( <b>1d4+1 damage </b>). With a successful claw attack it can attempt to grab and pick up an opponent of 150 pounds or less (Dexterity check to avoid this). A grabbed opponent can still attack at a -4 penalty, or can break free with a successful Strength check instead of attacking. A glabrezu rarely drops a grabbed opponent unless it faces imminent death.</p>
					<p>In addition to those available to all tanar'ri, glabrezu can use the following spell-like powers at 10th level of spell use: <i>burning hands </i>, <i>charm person </i>, <i>confusion </i>, <i>detect magic </i>(always active), <i>dispel magic </i>, <i>enlarge </i>, <i>mirror image </i>, <i>power word stun </i>(7 times per day), <i>reverse gravity </i>, and <i>true seeing </i>(always active). Once per day a glabrezu can <i>gate </i>in one greater tanar'ri with a 50% chance of success.</p>
					<p>These creatures are <b><u>immune to all nonmagical attacks such as fire, gas, acid, etc </u></b>., and to weapons of less than +2 magical enchantment.</p>
					<p>Due to their role in tanar'ri society, glabrezu can <i>plane shift </i>at will. They rarely do this of their own volition, however, prefening to leave the Abyss only when summoned.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Glabrezu are the covert agents of the underworld. They lure weak and impulsive mortals into giving them power. When a mortal mage summons a glabrezu, the mage is confident that strong magic will master the situation. But mags are short-sighted compared to the immortal glabrezu. The glabrezu knows that with each summoning, its power there, like a seed of evil, germinates and begins to grow.</p>
					<p>Glabrezu possess rich treasure that they hoard in vast subterranean lairs in the Abyss. With these masses of gold, magic, and wealth they tempt mortals into summoning them.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Glabrezu leech power from other planes and exert their influence there with surgical precision. Although they take little part in the shughter of the Blood War, their subtle manipulations and subjugations are a deeper evil. They do not get on well with mariliths.</p>

					<p>The hezrou, among the least powerful of the true tanar'ri, are still creatures of formidable power. They perform the will of the nalfeshnee by wandering the Abyss and overseeing the formation of armies.</p>
					<p>Hezrou look like large, roughly humanoid toads with arms in place of forelegs. They stand upright or on all four limbs by turns. They have rows of blunt, powerful teeth; spines run the length of their back.</p>
					<p>Hezrou communicate using telepathy.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Hezrou are impossible to surprise. They are <b><u>immune to attacks from nonmagical weapons and take half damage from all nonmagical attack forms (fire, poison, acid, etc </u></b>.) Hezrou have infravision to 120' and have double human normal auditory and olfactory senses.</p>
					<p>Hezrou are foul-tempered and mean. They attack even those that follow their instructions, just for sheer entertainment. Their claw attacks inflict <b>1d6 damage </b>, and their blunt, crushing teeth inflict 4d4 points per bite.</p>
					<p>If both claw attacks successfully hit a target in the same round, the victim is in a powerful hear hug and cannot attack. The victim takes <b>2d4 damage </b>per round and the hezrou's bite attacks automatically hit. The victim must succeed in a Strength check against one half its Strength score to escape the hug. A hezrou that takes 20 hp damage in one round releases its victim.</p>
					<p>The amphibious, frog-like skin of a hezrou emits a foul liquid that coats its skin. <b><u>Anyone within 10 feet of the creature must save vs. paralyzation or be overcome by its powerful stench </u></b>. Anyone so overcome lies helpless on the ground, gagging and vomiting. Those that do successfully make their saving throw still take a -2 penalty to their attack and initiative rolls.</p>
					<p>In addition to those available to all tanar'ri, hezrou have the following spell-like powers, at 9th level of spell use: <i>animate object </i>, <i>blink </i>, <i>duo-dimension </i>(3 times per day), <i>produce flame </i>, <i>protection from normal missiles </i>, <i>summon insects </i>, <i>unholy word </i>(reverse of <i>holy word </i>), and <i>wall of fire </i>. Three times per day they can attempt to <i>gate </i>in 4-40 least, 1-10 lesser, or 1-4 greater tanar'ri with a 5O% chance of success. Once per day, they can attempt to gate in 1 true tanar'ri with a 20% chance of success.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Hezrou are the long arm of the imperious nalfeshnee. They walk among the layers of the Abyss enforcing directions of the higher true tanar'ri. Due to the chaotic nature of the Abyss, the hezrou's services are vital.</p>
					<p>At certain times in a century, the hezrou can <i>plane shift </i>at will. During these Dark Walks, as they are known, the hezrou go forth and make pacts with mortals. They willingly enter into service to a mortal, typically one in dire need, but exact a heavy toll. In exchange for a major service, such as destroying an enemy's castle or retrieving a lost artifact, the hezrou secure eternal subservience by the mortal, a family member, friend, or lover. The victims come to the Abyss and serve as manes.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>As true tanar'ri, the hezrou are integral to the Blood War. They enforce the will of true tanar'ri, so they are spared certain death in frontline duty.</p>
					<p>Hezrou are not as intelligent or intuitive as the other true tanar'ri. This is ideal for their duties, however, for theirs is to obey and enforce.</p>

					<p>Bold and cunning, mariliths are the generals and tacticians for the Blood War. Where balors are the influence and energy behind the war effort, mariliths are the brains and tactics.</p>
					<p>Mariliths appear as half snake, half humanoid. From the waist down, these creatures have the bodies of giant snakes, with huge, green, scaly coils. Above the waist they are beautiful, comely females. Besides the obvious snake body, the feature that identifies a marilith is its six arms. They are commonly adorned with precious jewelry and bear highly decorated weapons: marilith usually carry a different weapon in each hand. They communicate using telepathy.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Mariliths are never surprised. Although they are strategists and tacticians, Mariliths love physical combat when opportunity presents. They size up any combat before getting involved and take full advantage of terrain, obstacles, and the opponent's disadvantages. They can attack with each of their six arms and constrict a victim with their snaky tails, as well.</p>
					<p>Weapons of +1 or lesser magical enchantment cannot harm a marilith. They cannot be fooled by illusions and are <b><u>immune to mind-affecting spells </u></b>.</p>
					<p>Mariliths favor exotic swords and axes. The DM should assign specific weapons; 90% of them should be magical (+1, +2, etc.), and 15% of these should be special. Marilith cherish their weapons; if one is lost or stolen, the owner will go to great lengths to recover it.</p>
					<p>A marilith can constrict with its deadly tail. If the tail hits in combat, it wraps around a victim to crush the life out of him. The tail inflicts 4d6 points of crushing damage and drives the breath from a victim. Once constricted, the victim automatically takes <b>4d6 damage </b>each round. Additionally, the trapped creature must make a Constitution check every round or fall unconscious. No opponent with less than 15 Strength can even hope to break free of the coils. Each round, there is a 10% chance per round per point of Strength over 14 that the victim can escape.</p>
					<p>In addition to those available to all tanar'ri, mariliths have the following spell-like powers: <i>animate dead </i>, <i>cause serious wounds </i>(reverse of <i>cure serious wounds </i>), <i>cloudkill </i>, <i>comprehend languages </i>, <i>curse </i>(reverse of <i>bless </i>), <i>detect evil </i>, <i>detect magic </i>, <i>detect invisibility </i>, <i>polymorph self </i>(7 times per day), <i>project image </i>, <i>pyrotechnics </i>, and <i>telekinesis </i>. They can also attempt to <i>gate </i>in 2-20 least tanar'ri, 1-6 lesser tanar'ri, 1-4 greater tanar'ri, or 1 true tanar'ri once per hour with a 35% chance of success.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>As noted, marilith are the strategists of the Blood War. They devise battle tactics and coordinate the true tanar'ri (except for the balors, of course). Due to the chaotic nature of the other tanar'ri, coordinating their activities is nearly impossible.</p>
					<p>Mariliths hate the glabrezu. They feel that the subtle warfare of the glabrezu is a childrens' game and inferior to proper warfare. Mariliths try to discredit the glabrezu in any way they can. They would completely destroy the subtle beasts, but the all-powerful balors favor the glabrezus' tactics.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Marilith secretly feel that they are the true force behind the Blood War, that the balors have their place only because of their great power, and are otherwise unnecessary. They may be right, but the power of the balors remains unchallenged.</p>

					<p>Few beings terrify mortals more than the nalfeshnee. Mortals who pass into the Abyss eventually come before one of these 'lords of woe', there to suffer judgment and the pain of transformation.</p>
					<p>Nalfeshnee are 20' tall; most of their immense strength goes simply to support their bodies. They combine the worst features of ape and boar, and their small wings appear unable to bear their ponderous bodies. Nalfeshnee have red, glowing eyes that pierce the mind and seem to draw energy from just a glance.</p>
					<p>Nalfeshnee can communicate with any being using a powerful form of telepathy.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Nalfeshnee are never surprised. They are <b><u>immune to weapons of less than +2 enchantment, but can be hit by weapons of cold-wrought iron </u></b>.</p>
					<p>Though the nalfeshnee usually sit atop their thrones and judge the masses of mortal lives in the Abyss, they are capable in battle. They can attack with two claws ( <b>1d4 damage </b>each) and bite ( <b>2d4 damage </b>), but prefer a special attack that looks like the <i>color spray </i>spell (usable three times per day). They must concentrate for an entire melee round; hits on the creature during that round do not break concentration. Then the nalfeshnee releases multiple rainbow beams that shoot in every direction. <b><u>All creatures within 60' suffer 15 hp damage (save vs. spell for half damage) </u></b>. <b><u>They must then again save vs. spell with -2 penalty </u></b>. Failure means they are temporarily stricken dumb and wander in a trance for 1d10 rounds. In that trance each creature a vision of its greatest fear.</p>
					<p>In addition to the standard abilities of all tanar'ri, nalfeshnee have the following spell-like powers: <i>alter self </i>, <i>bind </i>, <i>call lightning </i>, <i>chill touch </i>, <i>detect invisibility </i>(always active), <i>distance distortion </i>, <i>ESP </i>(always active), <i>feeblemind </i>, <i>forget </i>, <i>giant insect </i>, <i>invisibility </i>, <i>know alignment </i>(always active), <i>mirror image </i>, <i>protection from good </i>(always active), <i>raise dead </i>, <i>slow </i>, and <i>web </i>. Nalfeshnee can also attempt to gate in 1-6 babaus or 1 vrock, twice per day, with a 50% chance of success.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Nalfeshnee are the most intelligent tanar'ri, considering themselves superior even to the balors. Nalfeshnee do not act on this feeling because they recognize the balors' greater strength. However, a nalfeshnee seldom passes up an opportunity to secretly embarrass a balor, foil its plans, or even prolong the Blood War. The nalfeshnee rule the 400th layer of the Abyss, where they sit on flaming thrones on the Mountain of Woe. There they judge the mortal life forces that pass into the Abyss.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Nalfeshnee feed on hatred and despair, emotions they can draw out of any being they see. They devour these feelings from the life forces they judge, leaving empty husks of useless thoughts. These husks then transform into other forms of tanar'ri in ceremonies involving unimaginable torture.</p>

					<p>The vrock serve as elite fighting troops in the Blood War. Vrock look like a cross between a large human and a vulture, with strong, sinewy limbs covered with fine gray feathers; long necks and vulture heads; and wicked claws and beak.</p>
					<p>Vrock communicate using telepathy.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Vrocks are never surprised and always attack first in melee. These creatures have Strength 19 (+7 damage adjustment) and infravision to 120'. Vrocks are <b><u>immune to attacks from nonmagical weapons </u></b>.</p>
					<p>Vicious fighters, the vrocks can attack five times per melee round. Because of their dexterity and extreme battle prowess, vrocks can direct each of these attacks against different opponents. Their hand claw attacks each inflict <b>1d8 damage </b>. Their beaks inflict <b>1d6 damage </b>per successful hit. Vrocks can also attack with their foot claws, inflicting only <b>1d4 damage </b>because the vrock is off balance when attacking this way.</p>
					<p>The vrocks also attack with a stinging ejection of spores from small glands about the creatures' bodies. They can attack once every three melee rounds with a spore attack. A spray of spores automatically inflicts <b>1d8 damage </b>on all opponents within 5 feet. Once the spores have hit, they implant themselves just below the surface of the skin and begin to grow and sprout. Victims suffer <b>1d2 damage </b>per round from spore growth. The spores continue to grow for 10 melee rounds, at which time the victim is covered with thick, vine-like growths. The spores can be killed by a <i>bless </i>, <i>neutralize poison </i>, or similar spell or by being sprinkled with holy water. <i>Slow poison </i>stops the growth.</p>
					<p>Once per battle, a vrock can emit a loud, deafening screech. This screech deafens everyone within 30', stunning them for 1 round (Constitution check to avoid the stun). Vrock usually save their screech for emergencies and typically use it when near death, screeching just before they <i>teleport </i>away.</p>
					<p>In addition to those available to all tanar'ri, vrocks have the following spell-like powers at 10th level of spell use: <i>detect invisibility </i>, <i>detect magic </i>, <i>dispel magic </i>, <i>mass charm </i>, <i>mirror image </i>, and <i>telekinesis </i>. They can attempt once per day to <i>gate </i>in 2-20 manes, 1-6 bar-lgura, or 1 nalfeshnee. There is a 50% chance of success.</p>
					<p>When five or more vrocks fight together in battle, they can attempt a special power called <i>dance of ruin </i>. The vrocks join hands in a circle, then dance wildly, screeching and chanting in ancient languages. After three rounds, a weave of energy crackles and scintillates in the air like lightning. <b><u>Anyone within 100 feet of the </u></b><b><i><u>dance of ruin </u></i></b><b><u>must save vs. death magic or suffer 2d20 damage </u></b><u>(save vs </u>. spells for half damage). If any vrock takes 20 or more points of damage during the three melee rounds, the <i>dance </i>is disrupted and must be started again. All creatures, including the vrock, are affected.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Vrocks are an elite fighting force used in important battles. They are often sent on missions such as infiltration and other covert missions.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Vrocks eat their fallen foes after combat. They are powerful fighting machines from birth. Vrocks are loyal to their own. They travel in groups of up to eight (more when entering battle) and in battle coordinate with each other with perfect timing.</p>

					<p>The legendary tarrasque, for there is fortunately only one known to exist, is the most dreaded monster native to the Prime Material plane. The creature is a scaly biped with two horns on its head, a lashing tail, and a reflective carapace.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>The tarrasque is a killing machine and when active (see below) eats everything for miles around, including all animals and vegetation. Normal attacks are with its two forelimb claws ( <b>1d12 points of damage </b>each), a sweeping tail lash ( <b>2d12 points of damage </b>), a savage bite ( <b>5d10 points of damage </b>plus acts as a <i>sword of sharpness </i>, severing a limb on a natural attack roll of 18 or better), and two thrusting horn attacks ( <b>1d10 points of damage </b>each).</p>
					<p>Once every turn, the normally slow-moving tarrasque can rush forward at a movement rate of 15, making all horn attacks cause double damage and trampling anything underfoot for 4d10 points of crushing damage.</p>
					<p>The mere sight of the tarrasque causes creatures with less than 3 levels or Hit Dice to be paralyzed with fright (no saving throw) until it is out of their vision. <b><u>Creatures of 3 or more levels or Hit Dice flee in panic, although those of 7 or more levels or Hit Dice that manage to succeed with a saving throw vs. paralyzation are not affected (though they often still decide to run away) </u></b>.</p>
					<p>The tarrasque's carapace is exceptionally tough and highly reflective. Bolts and rays such as <i>lightning bolts </i>, <i>cones of cold </i>, and even <i>magic missiles </i>are useless against it. The reflection is such that 1 in 6 of these attacks actually bounces directly back at the caster (affecting him normally), while the rest bounce off harmlessly to the sides and into the air.</p>
					<p>The tarrasque is also <b><u>immune to all heat and fire, and it regenerates lost hit points at a rate of 1 hit point per round </u></b>. Only enchanted weapons ( <b><u>+1 or better) have any hope of harming the tarrasque </u></b>. The Tarrasque is totally <b><u>immune to all psionics </u></b>.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>It is fortunate that the tarrasque is active only for short periods of time. Typically, the monster comes forth to forage for a week or two, ravaging the countryside for miles around. The tarrasque then seeks a hidden lair underground and lies dormant, sleeping for 5d4 months before coming forth again. Once every decade or so, the monster is particularly active, staying awake for several months. Thereafter its period of dormancy is 4d4 years unless disturbed. The ratio of active to dormant states seems to be about 1:30.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Slaying of the tarrasque is said to be possible only if the monster is reduced to -30 or fewer hit points and a <i>wish </i>is then used. Otherwise, even the slightest piece of the tarrasque can regenerate and restore the monster completely. Legend says that a great treasure can be extracted from the tarrasque's carapace. The upper portion, treated with acid and then heated in a furnace, is thought to yield gems (10d10 diamonds of 1,000 gp base value each). The underbelly material, mixed with the creature's blood and adamantite, is said to produce a metal that can be forged by master dwarven blacksmiths into 1d4 shields of +5 enchantment. It takes two years to manufacture each shield, and the dwarves aren't likely to do it for free.</p>
					<p>It is hoped that the tarrasque is a solitary creation, some hideous abomination unleashed by the dark arts or by elder, forgotten gods to punish all of nature. The elemental nature of the tarrasque leads the few living tarrasque experts to speculate that the elemental princes of evil have something to do with its existence. In any case, the location of the tarrasque remains a mystery, as it rarely leaves witnesses in its wake, and nature quickly grows over all remnants of its presence. It is rumored that the tarrasque is responsible for the extinction of one ancient civilization, for the records of their last days spoke of a 'great reptilian punisher sent by the gods to end the world'.</p>
					<p>Note:</p>
					<p>Creatures with a minus THAC0 can only be hit on a 1.</p>

					<p>Chant has it that the thoqqua - also known as a rockworm or a fireworm - is a creature native to the Paraelemental Plane of Magma. This makes a certain amount of sense, but the fact is, the monster's found just as often on the Elemental Planes of Fire and Earth. On Earth, it's a hated vermin, attacked on sight by most intelligent denizens of the plane, yet that's also where it's happiest. On Fire, a thoqqua's relatively ignored by the other inhabitants, but its existence is misery. And on Magma, it achieves a balance between the two but never finds true contentment.</p>
					<p>See, the thoqqua is a creature of heat and fire that loves stone. It eats minerals and lives within solid rock. This dual nature has led the beast to develop a choleric mood and a foul temper - a thoqqua's never satisfied with its situation. When it comes across a basher, it's as likely to attack him as anything else, just out of mean-spiritedness.</p>
					<p>However, that's not due to evil intent. The thoqqua's limited intelligence focuses mainly on self-preservation and finding food. It spends its time burrowing through rock, which it does quite easily thanks to the great heat generated by its long, wormlike body. Chant is that even fire elementals themselves can't boast the heat produced in the heart of a thoqqua. Sure, that's probably a barmy's exaggeration, but it's still true that the creature can melt stone and metal with ease.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Despite their small size and fairly low Hit Dice total, the thoqquas inspire good, healthy fear in even the toughest of bloods. Inexperienced bashers should avoid them altogether. After all, fireworms give off enough heat to melt through rock - how hard would it be for them to melt their way through a person?</p>
					<p>The blistering touch of a thoqqua inflicts <b>2d6 points of damage </b>. Its most feared attack, however, is its charge into battle; the creature often lunges at a foe from within a nearby rock wall, floor, or ceiling (imposing -2 to the victim's surprise roll). In doing so, a thoqqua can move at a rate of 48 for up to 30 feet, inflicting <b>4d8 points of damage </b>due to the heat and the impact.</p>
					<p>Whenever a thoqqua strikes a sod (whether in a normal attack or a charge), the victim's equipment, armor, or clothing - whatever is actually touched - must make a successful saving throw or be destroyed by the scalding heat. Against a rockworm's charge, items make their saving throws at -4.</p>
					<p>A thoqqua can be struck by ordinary (nonmagical) weapons, but they might melt against its super-hot hide. Those that fail a saving throw are destroyed, and each weapon must make a new save every time it strikes the monster.</p>
					<p>Cold-based attacks inflict twice their normal damage on a thoqqua. On the other hand, heat makes a poor weapon. Fact is, when a bark uses a fire- or heat-based attack on a thoqqua, the creature gains one hit point for each point of damage that the assault would've caused. In this manner, it can attain a maximum of 48 hit points, which is twice its normal maximum amount, but the additional points last for only 5d8 rounds. When two or more thoqquas are encountered together, they often have inencreased hit point totals from supplementing each other's strength with their own heat.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>The thoqqua appears on many planes. While it doesn't have the power to travel the multiverse on its own, it seems to have a knack for finding vortices and borders which it can use to cross over. While the beast can survive on the planes of Magma, Earth, and Fire (though there's precious little for it to eat on Fire), it's truly at home on none.</p>
					<p>On the Elemental Plane of Earth, it burrows endlessly, devouring the melted slag as it goes. Native creatures view these passages as wounds upon their plane and destroy the thoqqua if they can. Certain others, particularly non-natives, appreciate the rockworm for the tunnels it forms. The shad, for example, use thoqqua burrows so frequently that sometimes their priests <i>charm </i>the creatures to create passages where the shad wish to go.</p>
					<p>A new rockworm's tunnel's usually about 4 feet in diameter, and a canny cutter knows to let it cool for a short while before using it. For the first 10 rounds after a thoqqua has passed, the walls of the fresh passage are visibly red-hot and burn anything that touches them (inflicting <b>1d10+4 points of damage </b>). For 10 rounds after that, even though the rock is cooling, any berk who touches the tunnel's walls still suffers <b>1d6+1 points of damage </b>. The victim is not allowed a saving throw in either case.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Chant is that the first bashers who ever ran across a rockworm thought it was the larval form of another creature, perhaps a salamander. Others (probably Clueless) believed that the thoqqua was a 'young elemental', though no one could agree on whether it belonged to Earth, Fire, or Magma. 'Course, today it's known that thoqquas are full-grown creatures in their own right, unrelated to any other beasts.</p>
					<p>Fireworms reproduce by budding, and thus are asexual. Young thoqquas exactly resemble their sires except that they're smaller (half the size of an adult, with half the hit points) and generate less heat (inflicting half as much damage).</p>
					<p>The thoqqua feeds on minerals and rocks of any kind. It attacks other creatures only out of belligerence or self-defense. Few beings prey on the fiery tunneller, though some of the dao and efreet look upon boiled rockworm as a delicacy.</p>

					<p>Tieflings are the offspring of the planes, as varied as the places they call home. Superficially human, their appearance always betrays them: some sport small horns, other have pointed ears, scales, a cloven hoof, or just a wicked gleam in their eye that never leaves. What they all have in common is a quick temper and a chip on their shoulder. They're often confused with alu-fiends, erinyes, incubi, and succubi (which they'll forgive), but never call a tiefling a bastard or a halfbreed. He'll take it personal-like. Plane-touched is the word, or 'sir' or 'lady.'</p>
					<p>Tieflings prefer dark clothing: a shade of maroon like clotted blood, dark forest green, blue as dark as lapis, and a midnight black that absorbs all light are their favorite colors. Their clothing is almost always a tight-fitting set of leggings, a vest, and tunic, combined with a loose flowing cape or long jacket with tails. They don't seem to walk so much as slither, and a basher never wants to see one in a rage - the howls are louder than Pandemonium and more dangerous than the Tenth Pit.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Tieflings are determined, stubborn, wily, and occasionally berserk warriors and talented mages. All tieflings gain a +1 bonus to Intelligence and Charisma, and suffer a -1 penalty to Strength and Wisdom. All tieflings have infravision to 60' and can create <i>darkness 15' radius </i>once per day. Mage tieflings prefer spells like <i>burning hands </i>, <i>unseen servant </i>, <i>blur </i>, <i>deeppockets </i>, <i>haste </i>, <i>fear </i>, and <i>domination </i>. Tiefling priests are well known for employing <i>protection from good </i>, <i>enthrall </i>, <i>flame walk </i>, and <i>undetectable lie </i>spells, though the Powers that grant these spells usually remain nameless. <b><u>All tieflings suffer only half damage from cold and gain a +2 to saving throws versus fire, electricity, and poison </u></b>.</p>
					<p>Because tieflings are not a brawny race, their weapons are light and quick, depending on speed and sharpness to make up for what they lack in weight and raw cleaving power. Despite its fragile appearance, tiefling weaponry is exceptionally deadly, not least because it is often poisoned. Typical weapons include the long sword, stiletto, throwing dagger, long spear, ranseur, hand crossbow, and scimitar. Punch daggers are also popular. Because almost half of all tieflings are ambidextrous, many fight in a two-handed style. Few tiefling warriors carry shields, prefering to rely on a form of well-crafted scale armor made from the hide of Lower Planar vermin.</p>
					<p>Player character tieflings can be fighters, rangers, wizards (including specialists), priests, thieves, or bards. They can also follow multi-classed roads: fighter/wizard, fighter/priest, fighter/thief, wizard/thief, and priest/thief. Tieflings can reach level 14 as wizards, 15 as rogues, 10 as priests, and 12 as fighters. Single-class characters can exceed these limits by two levels.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Tieflings have no true society of their own; they are the outcasts of the planes, cast out of the Lower Planes, not trusted in the upper planes. Though many of them gather in Sigil, just as many others try to carve out a home in their own planes. They don't trust others (what orphan does?), but their self-confidence is nothing short of astounding: a tiefling is said to have swum the River Styx because no one told him he couldn't, and another climbed to the fifth heaven of Mount Celestia before the archons noticed him lurking among the shadows and cast him into the Abyss.</p>
					<p>Tieflings have a reputation as great but deceitful lovers. Their fickleness in affairs of the heart is legendary, and seems closely bound to their reputation as tricksters, liars, and frauds. Tiefling gamblers rarely find planars to fleece; they depend on the clueless and the young to line their pockets.</p>
					<p>Though tieflings are usually loners, a charismatic and powerful tiefling sometimes gains a small following of like-minded, young tieflings who hope to ride his coattails. These packs are called 'schools', though they teach hard lessons. Each school serves to glorify its founder and protect its members - it does little else. Some schools operate as informal thieves' guilds, others are mage's societies, but almost all of them collapse when the founder dies. Some of them are remembered, like the School of Sergory, which has continued in a way, but with most of them even the name dies. Sergory was a master thief and mage, and other schools somtimes take his name to inflate their own importance. How (or even whether) Sergory met his end is dark, and best kept that way.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Tieflings are often persecuted by humans and others; 'If there's blame, find a tiefling,' 'Don't ever make a bet with a tiefling,' and 'If a tiefling didn't do it, he was just pressed for time' are common sayings in Sigil. Naturally, this makes tieflings a little defensive around others, but it doesn't make them band together, as it might for other oppressed races. Good tieflings are doubly committed to their cause, as if trying to make up for the race's bad reputation.</p>
					<p>Tieflings prefer to eat only meat, blood, bone, and marrow, preferably raw. They enjoy balaena blubber, gristle, and even roasted insects, which most races find disturbing. They drink strange concoctions of broth, oil, sulphur, and firewater, though they'll hoist an ale with any bubber in Sigil if nothing else is available. When meat is unavailable, they can live for short perions on ashes, coal, and other mineral matter.</p>

					<p>Titans are gargantuan, almost godlike men and woman. They, quite simply, look like 25' tall people of great physical strength and beauty. They are commonly dressed in traditional Greek garb, favoring togas, loincloths, and such. They wear rare and valuable jewelry and in other ways make themselves seem beautiful and overpowering.</p>
					<p>In addition to speaking their own language, titans are able to speak the six main dialects of giants. All titans are also conversant in the common tongue as well as that commonly spoken by forest creatures, as these giants have close ties with nature.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>The basic attack of titans is their great maul ( <i>maul of the titans </i>). These monstrous beings are capable of attacking twice in a melee round and inflicting <b>7-42 points of damage </b>per hit.</p>
					<p>Titans may choose to make a single other attack in a round. This form of special attack is so destructive and deadly, that a titan will use it only if there are no other options left open. The form of each titan's attack will be different (some kick, some punch, others use a breath attack, lightning, etc.), but the effect is the same for each. The special attack inflicts <b>10-60 points of damage </b>per hit and can be used every other round. These mighty attacks have been known to destroy buildings and sink ships.</p>
					<p>Titans can become ethereal twice per day. All titans are able to employ both mage or priest spells (dependent on the individual titan - only one, not both) as a 20th-level spell caster. In addition, all titans have the following spell-like powers, at 20th level of spell use, usable once per round, one at a time, at will: <i>advanced illusion </i>, <i>alter self </i>, <i>animal summoning II </i>, <i>astral spell </i>, <i>bless </i>, <i>charm person or mammal </i>, <i>commune with nature </i>, <i>cure light wounds </i>, <i>eyebite </i>, <i>fire storm </i>, <i>hold person </i>, <i>hold monster </i>, <i>hold undead </i>, <i>invisibility </i>, <i>levitate </i>, <i>light </i>, <i>mirror image </i>, <i>pass without trace </i>, <i>produce fire </i>, <i>protection from evil, 10' radius </i>, <i>remove fear </i>, <i>remove curse </i>, <i>shield </i>, <i>speak with plants </i>, <i>summon insects </i>, and <i>whispering wind </i>.</p>
					<p>Titans are not affected by attacks from nonmagical weapons.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Titans are livers of life, creators of fate. These benevolent giants are closer to the well springs of life than mere mortals and, as such, revel in their gigantic existences. Titans are wild and chaotic. They are prone to more pronounced emotions that humans and can experience godlike fits of rage. They are, however, basically good and benevolent, so they tend not to take life. They are very powerful creatures and will fight with ferocity when necessary.</p>
					<p>To some, titans seem like gods. With their powers they can cause things to happen that, surely, only a god could. They are fiery and passionate, displaying emotions with greater purity and less reservation than mortal beings. Titans are quick to anger, but quicker still to forgive. In fits of rage they destroy mountains and in moments of passion will create empires. They are in all ways godlike and in all ways larger than life.</p>
					<p>And yet is should be noted that titans are not gods. They are beings that make their home in Olympus and walk among the gods. Yet they are not omnipotent, omniscient rulers of the planes. Sometimes their godlike passions and godlike rages make them seem like deities, however, and it is common for whole civilizations to mistake them for deities.</p>
					<p>In one society, Jeuron, a titan with dominion over knowledge, was revered as a god for centuries. Those mortals built their whole civilization around him and Jeuron revelled in the worship. He even walked among them occasionally to see their love and admiration. But Odin, of the Norse mythos, discovered his deception and punished Jeuron by shackling him to the bottom of the deepest sea for 100 years.</p>
					<p>Titans have a natural affinity for storm giants. Those giants are the closest beings the titans have found to peers and they will readily befriend them. In any group of titans, there is a 35% chance that they will be accompanied by one or more storm giants. Although titans can sometimes be condescending by nature, they never treat the storm giants as subordinates or inferiors.</p>
					<p>On Olympus, titans have developed a culture similar to what they found there. They wear similar clothing, eat similar foods, play similar music, etc. It is unclear why this has occurred. Perhaps the titans, in a godlike whim, adopted their favorite mortal lifestyle. Such would not be unusual for these great beings.</p>
					<p>Titans primarily dwell in great palaces and mansions in Olympus where they live their lives whimsically. There they will dance, sing, study, debate and engage in all other manner of activities with titanic proportion. If a titan finds something that interests him, it would not be unusual for him to study it in great detail for many weeks, only to leave it when his interest has waned. They may also engage in debates or arguments that last literally for weeks at a time. These debates might end in a jovial laughter and good spirits or in thunder and rage. Such are the whims of titans.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Titans are basically identical to humans, except much larger. What makes them immortal is not known. Perhaps it is their enchanted existence in the halls of Olympus.</p>
					<p>These giants are commonly known to experience the same range of emotions as humans do. They develop idiosyncrasies as humans do, also. In fact, titan mannerisms emulate those of humans very closely. Again, it is difficult to tell if the titans are whimsically copying humans, or vice versa.</p>
					<p>Titans, being godlike creatures, tend to be very diverse and unique. Each individual titan (or sometimes group of titans) have a special power is that related to their personality or sphere of influence. These powers are very different, and usually very strong. Some examples of the powers of a titan are explained below:</p>
					<p><i>Algorn </i>, a titan that has influence over the seas, has the ability to <i>create water </i>whenever he chooses to. This water can be vast as he desires, up to the volume of a medium-sized lake. Algorn can simply cause the water to flow, he can cause it to jet out from his hands (washing away everything in its path away), or he can even cause the water to be frozen.</p>
					<p><i>Mane </i>, a titan with dominion over felines, has the ability to change into a giant form of any cat. When he transforms, he is instantly cured of all wounds, poisons, and diseases. Mane may change into a cat and back again five times per day.</p>
					<p><i>Porphyl </i>is a titan with the power of growth. He may cause any immature life to grow to maturity. Thus, he can cause crops to grow, he can make a boy grow to manhood, etc. Porphyl is very wise and would never abuse his ability.</p>
					<p><i>Malephus </i>, a titan with influence over law and justice can unerringly detect any spoken lie and any bad intention. He is often used by many greater powers in trials of justice. Malephus is totally honest; he is incapable of lies or deception.</p>
					<p>Syllia, a titan with power over love, can remove any negative feelings from any being (except deities and powers). She has the ability to remove hatred, unhappiness, depression, etc. Syllia cannot remove the feeling permanently, but for at least a day or so. The deities of the upper planes often employ her power when trying to stop wars.</p>
					<p><i>Girzon </i>, a titan with dominion over death, can take the life from any living being. It should be noted that Girzon has never used this ability unless commanded to by a deity. Girzon's restraint and self-control is revered by other titans.</p>
					<p><b>Greater Titans</b></p>
					<p>Rumors exist of a race of titans more powerful still than common titans. These greater titans are said to be very close to the gods and always accompany one (with some deities and powers being attended by more than one greater titan). Perhaps greater titans were formally common titans who have grown so great in power that the gods brought them closer to themselves. Such matters are not common knowledge.</p>
					<p>It is very difficult to provide combat statistics for greater titans. Like the gods themselves, greater titans are simply not subject to aggression from nondivine beings. They are never harmed by such attacks.</p>

					<p>Treants are strangely related to both humans and trees, combining features of both species. Peaceful by nature, treants can cause great damage when roused to anger. They hate evil things and the unrestrained use of fire.</p>
					<p>Treants are almost indistinguishable from trees. Their skin is a thick, textured, brown bark. Their arms are gnarled like branches and their legs fit together when standing like the trunk of a tree. Above the eyes and along the head are dozens of smaller branches from which hang great leaves. In winter the leaves of a treant change color but rarely fall out. Treants are very intelligent and often speak a number of languages including their own, elf, dwarf, common, and a smattering of just about all other humanoid tongues (at least enough to say 'Get out of my trees!').</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>The combat ability of treants varies with their size. Young treants (13 or 14 feet) have 7 or 8 Hit Dice and inflict <b>2-16 points of damage </b>per attack. Middle-aged treants (15 or 16 feet) have 9 or 10 Hit Dice, respectively, and inflict <b>3-18 points of damage </b>per attack. Elder treants (17 or 18 feet) have 11 or 12 Hit Dice and inflict <b>4-24 points of damage </b>per attack.</p>
					<p>Due to their tough, barklike skin, treants have a superior Armor Class rating against almost all weapons. Their only weakness is fire. Any fire-based attack against a treant is at +4 to hit and +1 damage. In addition, treants save against all fire-based attacks at -4. This weakness to fire also applies to animated trees controlled by a treant.</p>
					<p>Treants have the ability to animate normal trees. One treant can animate up to two trees. It takes one round for a normal tree to uproot itself. Thereafter the animated tree can move at a rate of 3 per turn and fights as a full-grown treant (12 Hit Dice, two attacks, <b>4-24 points of damage </b>per attack). A treant must be within 60 yards of the tree it is attempting to animate. Animated trees lose their ability to move if the treant who animated them is incapacitated or moves more than 60 yards away.</p>
					<p>Treants (regardless of size) and treant-controlled trees can inflict structural damage when attacking a building or fortification.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Treants live in small communities, usually amidst old hardwood forests (oak, maple, mahogany, etc.). In the forest treants rarely reveal themselves, preferring not to interact with the more transient lifeforms (anything with a lifespan of 500 years or less). Humans and demihumans have only a slight chance of spotting a treant who is trying to blend in with the trees. Rangers have a fair chance of spotting a treant (10% per level).</p>
					<p>Treants are intolerant of evil, particularly when fire and the wanton destruction of trees is involved. They hate orcs and goblins with a passion and tend to be suspicious of anyone carrying an ax.</p>
					<p>Treants have no use for treasure, and usually place all such items somewhere out of sight, such as under a great rock. Occasionally a treant can be convinced to give up his treasure but only when some great good will be accomplished by this generosity.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Treants, like all trees, gain sustenance via photosynthesis. Treants often sleep for long periods of time (anywhere from a few days to several years) during which short roots grow into the ground beneath them gathering water and minerals from the soil. Reproduction is via off-shoot stalks which the female treants then protect and care for until the stalks are grown.</p>
					<p>The lifespan of a treant is not known, but is several thousand years at least. As they grow older, treants become slower and less agile, sleeping for longer periods and talking less of things that are and more of things that were. Eventually an old treant will not wake up, taking permanent root in the spot where he sleeps and living out the rest of his life as a normal tree.</p>

					<p>Tritons are rumored to be creatures from the elemental plane of Water that have been placed on the Prime Material plane for some purpose unknown to man. They are sea dwellers, inhabiting warmer waters principally but equally able to live at shallow or great depths.</p>
					<p>The lower half of a triton ends in two finned legs, while its torso, head, and arms are handsomely human. Tritons have a silvery skin that fades into silver-blue scales on the lower half of their bodies. Their hair is deep blue or blue-green. Triton speak their own language as well as those of sea elves and locathah.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Tritons carry either tridents (60%) or long spears (40%). Some 25% are also armed with heavy crossbows. When equipped for battle, tritons wear armor made of scales (AC 4).</p>
					<p>Outside their lair, tritons are 90% likely to be mounted, either on hippocampi (65%) or giant sea horses (35%). These mounts fight in defense of their riders.</p>
					<p>Exceptional tritons (see below) and triton leaders always carry conch shells with them. Not magical, their sounds are well known to all marine creatures. When blown properly by an exceptional triton, a conch summons 5d4 hippocampi, 1d10 sea lions, or 5d6 giant sea horses. These creatures swim to the aid of the summoning triton, arriving 1d6 rounds after the conch is first sounded. The conchs can also be sounded to frighten aquatic animals as the <i>fear </i>spell. This latter noise causes all marine creatures within 60 feet and with animal Intelligence or less to flee in panic. <b><u>Creatures are allowed a saving throw vs. spell to avoid the fear effect, but even those who succeed with their saving throws have a -5 modifier on their attack rolls against the tritons </u></b>.</p>
					<p>Triton are reclusive and nonviolent. They normally attack to capture. If a triton is killed in a battle, however, the fight immediately becomes one of retribution. Should the fighting go poorly, the tritons withdraw to their lair to either gather reinforcements or make a last stand.</p>
					<p>In addition to their other abilities, tritons are nearly impervious to magic with a natural magic resistance of 90%.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Tritons live either in great undersea castles (80% chance) or in finely sculpted caverns (20%). While tritons lean toward good alignment, they are very suspicious of outsiders and have no love for land dwellers in general.</p>
					<p>Tritons rarely kill, unless provoked, but they are quick to apprehend those who intrude upon their seas. Trespassers found guilty of intentionally entering triton waters or treasure seeking are left 'to the fate of the seas'. This means being stripped of all belongings and set adrift at least 10 miles from any shoreline. Characters ruled innocent by the triton court awaken the next day on some distant shore. Tritons never aid land dwellers unless their own interests are involved in the matter.</p>
					<p>For every 10 tritons encountered there is an exceptional triton of 4-6 Hit Dice. For every 20 encountered there is an exceptional triton with 7-8 Hit Dice. Groups of 50 or more are always accompanied by a triton leader (AC 2, 9 Hit Dice). There is a 10% chance for every 10 tritons encountered that they are accompanied by a triton mage of 1d6 levels.</p>
					<p>At a triton lair, the following additional tritons are always found:</p>
					<list>
						<li>60 males (with related exceptional tritons)</li>
						<li>One mage of 7th- to 10th-level ability</li>
						<li>One priest of 8th- to 11th-level ability</li>
						<li>Four priests of 2nd- to 5th-level ability</li>
						<li>Female tritons equal to 100% of males (2 HD, AC 6)</li>
						<li>Young equal to 100% of males (noncombatants)</li>
					</list>
					<p>There is also a 75% chance that the lair contains 2d6 sea lions as pets/guards.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Tritons are omnivorous and live on fish, shellfish, and sea weed. They have no natural enemies save the giant squid, which is <b><u>immune to the effects of their conch shells </u></b>. Normal triton live approximately 300 years while their leaders and spellcasters have life expectancies of 500 years or more.</p>

					<p>Troglodytes are a warlike race of carnivorous reptilian humanoids that dwell in natural subterranean caverns and in the cracks and crevices of mountains. They hate man above all other creatures and often launch bloody raids on human communities in search of food and steel.</p>
					<p>Troglodytes stand about 6 feet tall, are covered in roughened leathery scales, and have a toothy lizard-like head. Males are easily distinguished from females by the fin-like crest that runs across their heads and down their necks. Coloration for both sexes varies due to the troglodyte's chameleon-like ability to change skin tone, but grayish brown is most common. Most troglodytes wear little more than a leather weapons belt, with perhaps a small bag of semi-fresh meat. Leaders adorn their belts with pieces of steel, a sign of power in troglodyte culture. Troglodytes have excellent infravision (90-foot range). They speak their own language and no other.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Fifty percent of a troglodyte force use their teeth and claws. The remaining 50% use weapons: swords (5%), stone battle axes (10%), stone morning stars (10%), or two troglodyte javelins (25%). Of special note is the troglodyte javelin. These great darts grant a +3 bonus to the attack roll when thrown by a troglodyte; they cause <b>2d4 points of damage </b>. This bonus reflects the troglodytes' great skill with these darts. About 25% of troglodytes carry two such darts apiece.</p>
					<p>Troglodytes prefer ambushes to frontal assaults. Their favorite tactic is to pick a well-trod mountain or subterranean path and then use their chameleon power to blend in with the surrounding rocks. When a likely target walks by, the troglodytes hurl a volley of javelins (this attack gives opponents a -4 penalty to their surprise rolls, but only for the initial round). After a second volley, the troglodytes descend upon their hapless victims.</p>
					<p>When angered or engaged in melee, troglodytes secrete an oil that smells extremely disgusting to all humans and demihumans. <b><u>Those failing their saving throws vs. poison are so revolted as to lose 1d6 points of Strength </u></b>. This loss remains in effect for 10 rounds.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Troglodyte society is organized into clans, with each clan led by a chieftain (usually the biggest and most fearsome troglodyte). A number of subchieftains also are present, chosen from those troglodytes that most distinguished themselves in battle. Rank is loose and internal squabbles common. Most chieftains lead only as long as the clan stays fed (and not one meal longer).</p>
					<p>For every 10 troglodytes encountered there is one leader with 3 Hit Dice. For every 20 there are two subchieftains each with 4 Hit Dice. Groups of 60 or more always include the clan chieftain. The chieftain stands 7 feet tall, has 6 Hit Dice, and is accompanied by 2d4 guards with 3 Hit Dice each.</p>
					<p>Troglodytes usually set their lair near a human or demihuman settlement. This enables them to prey on both the settlers and their livestock. The lair itself is typically a large cave or cavern with a number of smaller chambers adjoining it for the females and hatchlings. Troglodyte lairs contain a number of females equal to 100% of the males. Females have 1+1 Hit Dice each and fight to the death in defense of the hatchlings. Hatchlings number about 50% of the male population and are noncombatants.</p>
					<p>Troglodytes value steel above all else, using it to make javelins and as a form of wealth. Individual troglodytes carry nothing of real worth, but their lair may contain considerable treasure amassed from their raids on the outside world. Often this wealth is carelessly strewn about, mixed in with half-eaten food, or just shoved into some out-of-the-way corner.</p>
					<p>On moonless nights, raiding parties of 50 or more troglodytes venture forth in search of steel and food. These attacks usually target human settlements, where the troglodytes can use their infravision and their chameleon power to maximum advantage.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Strict carnivores, troglodytes prefer human flesh over all others, but they won't hesitate to devour practically anything they can catch, including members of other troglodyte clans. Few creatures hunt troglodytes, for their taste is said to be even more vile than their odor.</p>

					<p>Trolls are horrid carnivores found in all climes, from arctic wastelands to tropical jungles. Most creatures avoid these beasts, since trolls know no fear and attack unceasingly when hungry. Their frame appears thin and frail, but trolls possess surprising strength. Their arms and legs are long and ungainly. The legs end in great three-toed feet, the arms in wide, powerful hands with sharpened claws. The trolls' rubbery hide is colored a moss green, mottled green and gray, or putrid gray. A writhing hairlike mass grows out of their skulls and is usually greenish black or iron gray in color. Their dull, sunken black eyes possess 90-foot infravision. Females are easily distinguished from males; they are both larger and more powerful than their male counterparts.</p>
					<p>Trolls walk upright but hunched forward with sagging shoulders. The trolls' gait is uneven and, when running, the arms dangle free and drag along the ground. For all this seeming awkwardness, trolls are very agile. They are masterful climbers and can scale even sheer cliffs with an 80% chance of success. Trolls have a poor hearing, but their sense of smell is superior.</p>
					<p>Trolls have no language of their own, using 'trollspeak', a guttural mishmash of common, giant, goblin, orc, and hobgoblin. Trollspeak is highly transient and trolls from one area are only 25% likely to be able to communicate with trolls from another.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Trolls attack with two clawed hands and their bite, and they can attack at multiple opponents. In the rare case that a troll wields a weapon, it attacks with a +8 damage bonus. Trolls regenerate at an amazing rate. Starting three rounds after first blood, the creatures recovers 3 hit points per round until healed. Trolls reduced to 0 or fewer hit points fall to the ground, incapacitated but not slain. Incapacitated trolls continue to regenerate and stand up to fight as soon as they have a positive number of hit points.</p>
					<p>When using an edged weapon, it is possible to sever the thin limbs of a troll (a natural 20 with an edged weapon is needed). Severed limbs continue to fight after separation from the body (hands squeeze, heads bite if stepped on, etc.). Attacks by severed limbs are at normal chances to hit. Separated limbs fight for the remainder of the battle, then scuttle back and rebind with the body once the battle is over. Limbs unable to reach the body to die within 24 hours, but this is of little consequence since trolls regenerate lost body parts (including the head) within a week. If a troll is dismembered and scattered, the largest surviving piece regenerates. The others die within one day if they cannot rejoin that piece.</p>
					<p>Only fire and acid cause permanent damage to trolls. These forms of attack destroy its regenerative ability. A troll reduced to 0 or fewer hit points and immersed in acid or burned with fire is killed.</p>
					<p>Trolls have no fear of death, and launch themselves into combat, flailing wildly at their opponents and biting whoever comes closest. They occasionally (25%) throw stones before closing with their victims. Thrown stones have a maximum range of 20 yards, weigh 10 to 20 pounds, and inflict <b>1d8 points of damage </b>.</p>
					<p>If confronted by a large natural or magical fire, trolls try to find some way around the flames.</p>
					<p>Trolls combine a ravenous appetite with limited intelligence, so they are frequently distracted and break off pursuit 50% of the time to pick up food dropped by fleeing prey.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Trolls can survive in all climes, but prefer dense forests and subterranean locales, since bright sunlight hurts their eyes; trolls suffer no combat penalties because of this. They usually make their lairs in caves, using great boulders to block the entrances. Inside a troll cave are a number of rough nests made of straw and grass, plus scattered bones and treasure from victims. If there are no caves in an area, trolls dig themselves a trollhole and cover its opening with twigs and leaves. Trollholes are usually built near trees and are 90% undetectable. Anyone who steps on a trollhole is 75% likely to fall through the leafy door and tumble into the den below.</p>
					<p>Trolls live in small packs of 3 to 12 trolls led by a dominant female who acts as shaman/chieftain. She casts priest spells at 7th level; spheres typically include Charm, Divination, Sun (Darkness only), and Weather. Leadership is only retained by combat, so fights for pack control are frequent. Often trolls rend each other limb from limb, but these battles are never fatal. Still, it is the custom of trolls to toss the loser's head a great distance from the fight scene, and frequently losers must sit and stew for a week until their new head grows in.</p>
					<p>The pack chieftain's duties are few. She leads the trolls on nightly forages, loping along, sniffing the air for prey. If a scent is found, the trolls charge, racing to get there first, and letting out a great cry once prey is spotted. In return for being the hunt leader, the shaman gets her choice of mates in the pack. Females give birth to a single troll about once every five years.</p>
					<p>Trolls have ravenous appetites, devouring everything from simple grubs to bears and humans. Their lairs are often located near human settlements or along well traveled roads, but not too near, for even trolls respect organized resistance by fire-bearing humans. Wandering trolls, in search of a new lair, travel by night and sleep by day. Ravenous from walking, these packs, on occasion, attack and devour entire humanoid villages.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Trolls prey on all but the most powerful of creatures. They respect and fear dragons, but they hate giants of good alignment and wage war with them frequently. The troll's green blood is used to manufacture both poison antidotes and healing potions. The blood from one troll, worth 400 gp, can make three such potions.</p>
					<p><b>Giant Two Headed Troll</b></p>
					<p>These ferocious troll/ettin crossbreeds posses a mottled greenish brown skin tone, and their dress is usually moth-eaten rags or animal skins. Two-headed trolls use trollspeak as their language.</p>
					<p>Though part ettin, these monsters retain many of the abilities of trolls. They regenerate like trolls, but only 1 hit point a round, and severed limbs cannot reattach (their thicker limbs are not cleaved on a roll of 20). Two-headed trolls attack with two claws and two bites. Both bite attacks are against one opponent, but the claws may be directed against different foes. The troll can, though rarely, wield a weapon with a +6 damage bonus. Like ettins, two-headed trolls are surprised only on a 1. These creatures live in damp, underground caverns and can be found leading groups of their smaller troll cousins.</p>
					<p><b>Freshwater Troll (Scrag)</b></p>
					<p>These gilled trolls, also called scrags or river trolls, are the most loathsome of all the trolls. River trolls, as their name implies, travel the waterways in search of victims. Their arms are thin and frail but their mouths are wide and lined with dozens of needle-sharp fangs. Their color ranges from blue-green to olive. Scrags have all of the abilities of normal trolls, but they only regenerate when immersed in fresh water. Scrags can survive out of water for one hour and often come ashore in search of prey. River trolls devour anything they catch, but prefer humanoids and have a fondness for dwarves.</p>
					<p>Scrags are devious hunters and often carry a few baubles with them. They lay gems near the water's edge and wait for someone to spot them and reach down. Other traps include burying themselves in the sand, in shallow water, and waiting to be stepped on or tangling the rudders of small boats. River trolls occasionally nest beneath bridges or near ferry boats, demanding a toll in exchange for passage. The toll varies, but averages the equivalent of one cow per week, per troll. Livestock and children frequently disappear when river trolls are near. Scrag shamans also have access to Elemental (water) spells.</p>
					<p><b>Saltwater Troll (Marine Scrag)</b></p>
					<p>Like freshwater scrags, marine scrags can breathe air for one hour and have all of the abilities of normal trolls, except they regenerate only when immersed in saltwater. Large, green, and pot-bellied, marine scrags are thick-skinned and heavily scaled. Limp hair, the color of seaweed, hangs down to their shoulders. Their feet are wide and webbed to aid them in swimming. While their limbs are shorter and weaker than those of ordinary trolls, their mouths are larger and filled with hundreds of needle-sharp teeth. Marine scrags can subsist on fish and shellfish, but crave human flesh. They create their lairs in shallow ocean caves or beneath city docks. They emerge from their caves at night, climbing over ship railings in search of sailors or hunting the piers for a strolling couple or a lone drunk. Their attacks are quick and stealthy; they usually hunt in packs of four to six, but occasionally, several dozen may attack a large ship. Marine scrag shamans also have access to Elemental (water) spells.</p>
					<p><b>Desert Trolls</b></p>
					<p>Desert trolls are usually tan, but can modify their color from bleached tan to mottled rock brown, causing a -2 penalty to opponents' surprise rolls. Their keen senses and animal cunning reduce their chances of being surprised to 1-in-10. Like normal trolls, the desert variety usually attacks with two claws and a bite.</p>
					<p>Desert trolls are <b><u>immune to normal fire, heat, and cold </u></b>. They do not regenerate acid damage, damage from magical fire, or fire breath weapons. In addition, they suffer damage from normal water that cannot be regenerated. Normal water inflicts <b>1d4 points of damage </b>per vial, 2d4 points per flask, and 4d4 points per skin. A decanter of endless water aimed directly at a desert troll (successful attack roll required) causes 25 points of damage per round. Purified water (including normal and holy water) causes double damage. <b><u>A potion of sweet water causes 6d6 points of damage </u></b><u>and the troll must make a saving throw vs. poison or die </u>. These trolls are tougher and more tenacious than their more common counterparts, but they are also more solitary. They skulk at the edges of settled areas, waylaying travelers and polluting sources of pure water.</p>
					<p><b>Spectral Troll (Troll Wraith)</b></p>
					<p>Spectral trolls, taking material form only in darkness, are tormented by the memory of life. They try to slay all living creatures they encounter. Resembling normal trolls in all respects except color, their jet black skin and hair make them easily distinguishable from other trolls. Spectral trolls have the same attacks as regular trolls and can divide them among many opponents. A silver or magical weapon is needed to attack them, making the final disposition of a spectral troll an even trickier prospect.</p>
					<p>Being undead, spectral trolls can be turned by priests as though they were spectres. It is noted that a humanoid slain by a spectral troll becomes one itself in three days, unless a proper burial ceremony is performed by a priest of the victim's religion. Spectral trolls vanish in direct sunlight. They do not take damage from sunlight, they merely fade from view and reappear at the same spot at nightfall. Even those captured, unconscious, or trapped in temporal stasis have escaped permanent imprisonment in this manner.</p>
					<p><b>Giant Trolls</b></p>
					<p>Giant Trolls are hideous hill giant/troll crossbreeds. They resemble normal trolls in all respects, except for their unnatural size. Their skin is reddish brown and they have red-rimmed eyes.</p>
					<p>Despite their pot-bellied appearance, giant trolls are immensely strong and inflict damage like a hill giant when they are using their favorite weapon of attack - a large spiked club made from a tree trunk or a house timber. These clubs cause <b>2d6+7 points of damage </b>. In those rare instances when a giant troll has no weapons, its claws inflict <b>1d6+1 points of damage </b>; as with all trolls, the claw attacks can be divided among different opponents as necessary.</p>
					<p>Instead of using their claws to attack, weaponless giant trolls are more likely to grab medium-sized prey in their large hands and wield the struggling victim like a club, beating a new target with the body. Refer to the rules on hand-to-hand combat in the <i>Dungeon Masters Guide </i>for guidelines.</p>
					<p>Giant trolls who are overwhelmed by many small- and medium-sized opponents take time to grab and hurl the warriors into nearby trees, leaving more time to deal with the softer, weaker enemies. Note that, like hill giants, giant trolls can catch missiles 25% of the time, if in reach, and can hurl boulders that cause <b>2d8 points of damage </b>.</p>
					<p>Unlike normal trolls and their closer relatives, giant trolls never attack with their bite. This is due to the fact that they are much taller than the meals they like best (humanoids, of course), and they find it difficult to bend forward with the flexibility normal trolls enjoy. Then too, the head of a giant troll, more than any other part of the cross-breed anatomy, is almost identical to that of a hill giant, except that their skin is reddish brown. The giant troll also lacks the razor sharp teeth of normal trolls that strike fear in so many.</p>
					<p>Giant trolls regenerate damage as normal trolls, but at the rate of 2 hit points per round. They cannot reattach severed limbs. Before a giant troll can be killed, at least 10 points of damage must be inflicted on it by fire. If this condition is not met, and the giant troll is reduced to a single hit point, further damage has no effect, except to prevent regeneration.</p>
					<p>They have a very acute sense of smell and 90-foot infravision. Giant trolls are feared throughout the world, for not only do they possess the horrible ability to regenerate damage inflicted upon them, but they also possess the power and strength of hill giants (fearsome in their own right). The combination is a deadly one, and, even worse, giant trolls travel in loose tribal bands of 1dl2 members. They are rarely encountered alone. Lairs of giant trolls are always served by 2d6 normal trolls who act as simple lackeys (and sometimes food) for their larger cousins.</p>
					<p>Giant trolls are found in nearly every clime. Giant trolls are on good terms with strong hill giant tribes, for which they serve as elite personal guardians for the ruling chief.</p>
					<p><b>Ice Troll</b></p>
					<p>The ice troll is a smaller, more intelligent relative of the normal troll, and is probably the result of magical experimentation. It closely resembles its more common cousin, but has semitransparent, very cold skin. Ice trolls are famous for being cunning, evil creatures which keep humans and demi-humans as livestock. Because ice trolls need water to regenerate, they never leave their lakes and rivers, and will create elaborate traps to lure their prey to them.</p>
					<p>Ice trolls are organized and intelligent enough to know their weaknesses, and rarely start a fight at a disadvantage. Unlike their larger and less intelligent cousins, they do not wade into combat blindly, but will try to pick off weaker opponents one by one, hoping to bring back live prey. Ice trolls generally attack with claws for 1d8 hit points of damage each, but have been known to use weapons on rare occasions (10%), at an additional +4 to each weapon's damage due to Strength. Attacks may be directed against different opponents.</p>
					<p>The regenerative powers of ice trolls are not as great as normal trolls. An ice troll must be immersed in water to be able to regenerate 2 hit points per melee round. The creatures often make their stand in a shallow pool of water to keep this advantage.</p>
					<p>Because of the thin, brittle nature of the ice troll, it is possible to sever one of the creature's limbs with an edged weapon, on a natural attack roll of 20 with an edged weapon. Severed limbs also regenerate 2 hit points per turn, as long as they are immersed in water. If a severed limb is not in contact with water, it will move up to 30 feet in search of water, always moving toward it, if it is in range.</p>
					<p>Fire and acid are the only attack forms which negate the ice troll's ability to regenerate. Because of the ice troll's physiology, fire-based attacks do double damage. Ice trolls are unaffected by cold or cold-based spells, and because of their magical nature, can only be hit by magical weapons or missiles.</p>
					<p>Ice trolls live in groups of 7-12 in arctic and sub-arctic regions, near open water. Because they are smaller and less resilient than their larger cousins, they have developed a higher sense of cooperation to stay alive. Each group has a leader, usually the most intelligent. Leaders are responsible for keeping the group safe and well-fed.</p>
					<p>Ice trolls live near settled regions, hoping to waylay and capture humans and demi-humans. Ice trolls will frequently bait traps for adventurers, using treasure they have salvaged from previously waylaid groups. Settlements also provide more common livestock, which, although less preferable than human flesh, is considered edible in times of need. Ice trolls establish their lairs near lakes or rivers. Here the ice trolls will have gathered all their treasure, as well as 5-20 human or demi-human captives. These prisoners are kept well-fed on grains and vegetables, so that the ice trolls need never go too long without food.</p>
					<p>Ice trolls mate in the spring and give birth to one baby ice troll in the late fall. When an ice troll tribe gets too large, it splits, one group wandering off to find a new lair. Ice trolls that live in arctic regions often hunt remorhaz, and will even pick off a solitary frost giant. Ice troll blood is frequently used in the manufacture of <i>frost brand </i>swords, and <i>rings of cold resistance </i>.</p>
					<p><b>Spirit Trolls</b></p>
					<p>The spirit troll is an odious mutation of the spectral troll. Several schools of thought completely separate this creature from the spectral variety, presenting evidence that the spirit troll is a perverted magical interbreeding of trolls and invisible stalkers. The spirit troll is invisible; characters able to see invisible objects observe it to be very similar to a troll, slightly shorter and with diffused features. The spirit troll can only be hit by magical weapons. Fire inflicts full damage, but it is invulnerable to cold-based attacks. It regenerates as does a troll, and at the same rate. It attacks with its fangs and two sharp claws, against three different opponents if it so desired. The damage inflicted by its fangs (2d4+2) is normal damage, except that the spirit troll adds the damage to its own hit points - in effect healing itself! The damage inflicted by the spirit troll's claws (1d4+2) is taken not only from the victim's hit points but also from Strength. Strength points lost in this way are recovered in 2d4 turns. If a character's Strength is reduced to 0, the PC dies. If the Strength is reduced to 1 or 2 points, the PC is rendered comatose, only recovering when (and if) sufficient hit points are recovered to raise the Strength to 3 or more. The spirit troll has an acute sense of smell and superior, 120 foot-range, infravision.</p>

					<p>Trolls are horrid carnivores found in all climes, from arctic wastelands to tropical jungles. Most creatures avoid these beasts, since trolls know no fear and attack unceasingly when hungry. Their frame appears thin and frail, but trolls possess surprising strength. Their arms and legs are long and ungainly. The legs end in great three-toed feet, the arms in wide, powerful hands with sharpened claws. The trolls' rubbery hide is colored a moss green, mottled green and gray, or putrid gray. A writhing hairlike mass grows out of their skulls and is usually greenish black or iron gray in color. Their dull, sunken black eyes possess 90-foot infravision. Females are easily distinguished from males; they are both larger and more powerful than their male counterparts.</p>
					<p>Trolls walk upright but hunched forward with sagging shoulders. The trolls' gait is uneven and, when running, the arms dangle free and drag along the ground. For all this seeming awkwardness, trolls are very agile. They are masterful climbers and can scale even sheer cliffs with an 80% chance of success. Trolls have a poor hearing, but their sense of smell is superior.</p>
					<p>Trolls have no language of their own, using 'trollspeak', a guttural mishmash of common, giant, goblin, orc, and hobgoblin. Trollspeak is highly transient and trolls from one area are only 25% likely to be able to communicate with trolls from another.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Trolls attack with two clawed hands and their bite, and they can attack at multiple opponents. In the rare case that a troll wields a weapon, it attacks with a +8 damage bonus. Trolls regenerate at an amazing rate. Starting three rounds after first blood, the creatures recovers 3 hit points per round until healed. Trolls reduced to 0 or fewer hit points fall to the ground, incapacitated but not slain. Incapacitated trolls continue to regenerate and stand up to fight as soon as they have a positive number of hit points.</p>
					<p>When using an edged weapon, it is possible to sever the thin limbs of a troll (a natural 20 with an edged weapon is needed). Severed limbs continue to fight after separation from the body (hands squeeze, heads bite if stepped on, etc.). Attacks by severed limbs are at normal chances to hit. Separated limbs fight for the remainder of the battle, then scuttle back and rebind with the body once the battle is over. Limbs unable to reach the body to die within 24 hours, but this is of little consequence since trolls regenerate lost body parts (including the head) within a week. If a troll is dismembered and scattered, the largest surviving piece regenerates. The others die within one day if they cannot rejoin that piece.</p>
					<p>Only fire and acid cause permanent damage to trolls. These forms of attack destroy its regenerative ability. A troll reduced to 0 or fewer hit points and immersed in acid or burned with fire is killed.</p>
					<p>Trolls have no fear of death, and launch themselves into combat, flailing wildly at their opponents and biting whoever comes closest. They occasionally (25%) throw stones before closing with their victims. Thrown stones have a maximum range of 20 yards, weigh 10 to 20 pounds, and inflict <b>1d8 points of damage </b>.</p>
					<p>If confronted by a large natural or magical fire, trolls try to find some way around the flames.</p>
					<p>Trolls combine a ravenous appetite with limited intelligence, so they are frequently distracted and break off pursuit 50% of the time to pick up food dropped by fleeing prey.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Trolls can survive in all climes, but prefer dense forests and subterranean locales, since bright sunlight hurts their eyes; trolls suffer no combat penalties because of this. They usually make their lairs in caves, using great boulders to block the entrances. Inside a troll cave are a number of rough nests made of straw and grass, plus scattered bones and treasure from victims. If there are no caves in an area, trolls dig themselves a trollhole and cover its opening with twigs and leaves. Trollholes are usually built near trees and are 90% undetectable. Anyone who steps on a trollhole is 75% likely to fall through the leafy door and tumble into the den below.</p>
					<p>Trolls live in small packs of 3 to 12 trolls led by a dominant female who acts as shaman/chieftain. She casts priest spells at 7th level; spheres typically include Charm, Divination, Sun (Darkness only), and Weather. Leadership is only retained by combat, so fights for pack control are frequent. Often trolls rend each other limb from limb, but these battles are never fatal. Still, it is the custom of trolls to toss the loser's head a great distance from the fight scene, and frequently losers must sit and stew for a week until their new head grows in.</p>
					<p>The pack chieftain's duties are few. She leads the trolls on nightly forages, loping along, sniffing the air for prey. If a scent is found, the trolls charge, racing to get there first, and letting out a great cry once prey is spotted. In return for being the hunt leader, the shaman gets her choice of mates in the pack. Females give birth to a single troll about once every five years.</p>
					<p>Trolls have ravenous appetites, devouring everything from simple grubs to bears and humans. Their lairs are often located near human settlements or along well traveled roads, but not too near, for even trolls respect organized resistance by fire-bearing humans. Wandering trolls, in search of a new lair, travel by night and sleep by day. Ravenous from walking, these packs, on occasion, attack and devour entire humanoid villages.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Trolls prey on all but the most powerful of creatures. They respect and fear dragons, but they hate giants of good alignment and wage war with them frequently. The troll's green blood is used to manufacture both poison antidotes and healing potions. The blood from one troll, worth 400 gp, can make three such potions.</p>
					<p><b>Giant Two Headed Troll</b></p>
					<p>These ferocious troll/ettin crossbreeds posses a mottled greenish brown skin tone, and their dress is usually moth-eaten rags or animal skins. Two-headed trolls use trollspeak as their language.</p>
					<p>Though part ettin, these monsters retain many of the abilities of trolls. They regenerate like trolls, but only 1 hit point a round, and severed limbs cannot reattach (their thicker limbs are not cleaved on a roll of 20). Two-headed trolls attack with two claws and two bites. Both bite attacks are against one opponent, but the claws may be directed against different foes. The troll can, though rarely, wield a weapon with a +6 damage bonus. Like ettins, two-headed trolls are surprised only on a 1. These creatures live in damp, underground caverns and can be found leading groups of their smaller troll cousins.</p>
					<p><b>Freshwater Troll (Scrag)</b></p>
					<p>These gilled trolls, also called scrags or river trolls, are the most loathsome of all the trolls. River trolls, as their name implies, travel the waterways in search of victims. Their arms are thin and frail but their mouths are wide and lined with dozens of needle-sharp fangs. Their color ranges from blue-green to olive. Scrags have all of the abilities of normal trolls, but they only regenerate when immersed in fresh water. Scrags can survive out of water for one hour and often come ashore in search of prey. River trolls devour anything they catch, but prefer humanoids and have a fondness for dwarves.</p>
					<p>Scrags are devious hunters and often carry a few baubles with them. They lay gems near the water's edge and wait for someone to spot them and reach down. Other traps include burying themselves in the sand, in shallow water, and waiting to be stepped on or tangling the rudders of small boats. River trolls occasionally nest beneath bridges or near ferry boats, demanding a toll in exchange for passage. The toll varies, but averages the equivalent of one cow per week, per troll. Livestock and children frequently disappear when river trolls are near. Scrag shamans also have access to Elemental (water) spells.</p>
					<p><b>Saltwater Troll (Marine Scrag)</b></p>
					<p>Like freshwater scrags, marine scrags can breathe air for one hour and have all of the abilities of normal trolls, except they regenerate only when immersed in saltwater. Large, green, and pot-bellied, marine scrags are thick-skinned and heavily scaled. Limp hair, the color of seaweed, hangs down to their shoulders. Their feet are wide and webbed to aid them in swimming. While their limbs are shorter and weaker than those of ordinary trolls, their mouths are larger and filled with hundreds of needle-sharp teeth. Marine scrags can subsist on fish and shellfish, but crave human flesh. They create their lairs in shallow ocean caves or beneath city docks. They emerge from their caves at night, climbing over ship railings in search of sailors or hunting the piers for a strolling couple or a lone drunk. Their attacks are quick and stealthy; they usually hunt in packs of four to six, but occasionally, several dozen may attack a large ship. Marine scrag shamans also have access to Elemental (water) spells.</p>
					<p><b>Desert Trolls</b></p>
					<p>Desert trolls are usually tan, but can modify their color from bleached tan to mottled rock brown, causing a -2 penalty to opponents' surprise rolls. Their keen senses and animal cunning reduce their chances of being surprised to 1-in-10. Like normal trolls, the desert variety usually attacks with two claws and a bite.</p>
					<p>Desert trolls are <b><u>immune to normal fire, heat, and cold </u></b>. They do not regenerate acid damage, damage from magical fire, or fire breath weapons. In addition, they suffer damage from normal water that cannot be regenerated. Normal water inflicts <b>1d4 points of damage </b>per vial, 2d4 points per flask, and 4d4 points per skin. A decanter of endless water aimed directly at a desert troll (successful attack roll required) causes 25 points of damage per round. Purified water (including normal and holy water) causes double damage. <b><u>A potion of sweet water causes 6d6 points of damage </u></b><u>and the troll must make a saving throw vs. poison or die </u>. These trolls are tougher and more tenacious than their more common counterparts, but they are also more solitary. They skulk at the edges of settled areas, waylaying travelers and polluting sources of pure water.</p>
					<p><b>Spectral Troll (Troll Wraith)</b></p>
					<p>Spectral trolls, taking material form only in darkness, are tormented by the memory of life. They try to slay all living creatures they encounter. Resembling normal trolls in all respects except color, their jet black skin and hair make them easily distinguishable from other trolls. Spectral trolls have the same attacks as regular trolls and can divide them among many opponents. A silver or magical weapon is needed to attack them, making the final disposition of a spectral troll an even trickier prospect.</p>
					<p>Being undead, spectral trolls can be turned by priests as though they were spectres. It is noted that a humanoid slain by a spectral troll becomes one itself in three days, unless a proper burial ceremony is performed by a priest of the victim's religion. Spectral trolls vanish in direct sunlight. They do not take damage from sunlight, they merely fade from view and reappear at the same spot at nightfall. Even those captured, unconscious, or trapped in temporal stasis have escaped permanent imprisonment in this manner.</p>
					<p><b>Giant Trolls</b></p>
					<p>Giant Trolls are hideous hill giant/troll crossbreeds. They resemble normal trolls in all respects, except for their unnatural size. Their skin is reddish brown and they have red-rimmed eyes.</p>
					<p>Despite their pot-bellied appearance, giant trolls are immensely strong and inflict damage like a hill giant when they are using their favorite weapon of attack - a large spiked club made from a tree trunk or a house timber. These clubs cause <b>2d6+7 points of damage </b>. In those rare instances when a giant troll has no weapons, its claws inflict <b>1d6+1 points of damage </b>; as with all trolls, the claw attacks can be divided among different opponents as necessary.</p>
					<p>Instead of using their claws to attack, weaponless giant trolls are more likely to grab medium-sized prey in their large hands and wield the struggling victim like a club, beating a new target with the body. Refer to the rules on hand-to-hand combat in the <i>Dungeon Masters Guide </i>for guidelines.</p>
					<p>Giant trolls who are overwhelmed by many small- and medium-sized opponents take time to grab and hurl the warriors into nearby trees, leaving more time to deal with the softer, weaker enemies. Note that, like hill giants, giant trolls can catch missiles 25% of the time, if in reach, and can hurl boulders that cause <b>2d8 points of damage </b>.</p>
					<p>Unlike normal trolls and their closer relatives, giant trolls never attack with their bite. This is due to the fact that they are much taller than the meals they like best (humanoids, of course), and they find it difficult to bend forward with the flexibility normal trolls enjoy. Then too, the head of a giant troll, more than any other part of the cross-breed anatomy, is almost identical to that of a hill giant, except that their skin is reddish brown. The giant troll also lacks the razor sharp teeth of normal trolls that strike fear in so many.</p>
					<p>Giant trolls regenerate damage as normal trolls, but at the rate of 2 hit points per round. They cannot reattach severed limbs. Before a giant troll can be killed, at least 10 points of damage must be inflicted on it by fire. If this condition is not met, and the giant troll is reduced to a single hit point, further damage has no effect, except to prevent regeneration.</p>
					<p>They have a very acute sense of smell and 90-foot infravision. Giant trolls are feared throughout the world, for not only do they possess the horrible ability to regenerate damage inflicted upon them, but they also possess the power and strength of hill giants (fearsome in their own right). The combination is a deadly one, and, even worse, giant trolls travel in loose tribal bands of 1dl2 members. They are rarely encountered alone. Lairs of giant trolls are always served by 2d6 normal trolls who act as simple lackeys (and sometimes food) for their larger cousins.</p>
					<p>Giant trolls are found in nearly every clime. Giant trolls are on good terms with strong hill giant tribes, for which they serve as elite personal guardians for the ruling chief.</p>
					<p><b>Ice Troll</b></p>
					<p>The ice troll is a smaller, more intelligent relative of the normal troll, and is probably the result of magical experimentation. It closely resembles its more common cousin, but has semitransparent, very cold skin. Ice trolls are famous for being cunning, evil creatures which keep humans and demi-humans as livestock. Because ice trolls need water to regenerate, they never leave their lakes and rivers, and will create elaborate traps to lure their prey to them.</p>
					<p>Ice trolls are organized and intelligent enough to know their weaknesses, and rarely start a fight at a disadvantage. Unlike their larger and less intelligent cousins, they do not wade into combat blindly, but will try to pick off weaker opponents one by one, hoping to bring back live prey. Ice trolls generally attack with claws for 1d8 hit points of damage each, but have been known to use weapons on rare occasions (10%), at an additional +4 to each weapon's damage due to Strength. Attacks may be directed against different opponents.</p>
					<p>The regenerative powers of ice trolls are not as great as normal trolls. An ice troll must be immersed in water to be able to regenerate 2 hit points per melee round. The creatures often make their stand in a shallow pool of water to keep this advantage.</p>
					<p>Because of the thin, brittle nature of the ice troll, it is possible to sever one of the creature's limbs with an edged weapon, on a natural attack roll of 20 with an edged weapon. Severed limbs also regenerate 2 hit points per turn, as long as they are immersed in water. If a severed limb is not in contact with water, it will move up to 30 feet in search of water, always moving toward it, if it is in range.</p>
					<p>Fire and acid are the only attack forms which negate the ice troll's ability to regenerate. Because of the ice troll's physiology, fire-based attacks do double damage. Ice trolls are unaffected by cold or cold-based spells, and because of their magical nature, can only be hit by magical weapons or missiles.</p>
					<p>Ice trolls live in groups of 7-12 in arctic and sub-arctic regions, near open water. Because they are smaller and less resilient than their larger cousins, they have developed a higher sense of cooperation to stay alive. Each group has a leader, usually the most intelligent. Leaders are responsible for keeping the group safe and well-fed.</p>
					<p>Ice trolls live near settled regions, hoping to waylay and capture humans and demi-humans. Ice trolls will frequently bait traps for adventurers, using treasure they have salvaged from previously waylaid groups. Settlements also provide more common livestock, which, although less preferable than human flesh, is considered edible in times of need. Ice trolls establish their lairs near lakes or rivers. Here the ice trolls will have gathered all their treasure, as well as 5-20 human or demi-human captives. These prisoners are kept well-fed on grains and vegetables, so that the ice trolls need never go too long without food.</p>
					<p>Ice trolls mate in the spring and give birth to one baby ice troll in the late fall. When an ice troll tribe gets too large, it splits, one group wandering off to find a new lair. Ice trolls that live in arctic regions often hunt remorhaz, and will even pick off a solitary frost giant. Ice troll blood is frequently used in the manufacture of <i>frost brand </i>swords, and <i>rings of cold resistance </i>.</p>
					<p><b>Spirit Trolls</b></p>
					<p>The spirit troll is an odious mutation of the spectral troll. Several schools of thought completely separate this creature from the spectral variety, presenting evidence that the spirit troll is a perverted magical interbreeding of trolls and invisible stalkers. The spirit troll is invisible; characters able to see invisible objects observe it to be very similar to a troll, slightly shorter and with diffused features. The spirit troll can only be hit by magical weapons. Fire inflicts full damage, but it is invulnerable to cold-based attacks. It regenerates as does a troll, and at the same rate. It attacks with its fangs and two sharp claws, against three different opponents if it so desired. The damage inflicted by its fangs (2d4+2) is normal damage, except that the spirit troll adds the damage to its own hit points - in effect healing itself! The damage inflicted by the spirit troll's claws (1d4+2) is taken not only from the victim's hit points but also from Strength. Strength points lost in this way are recovered in 2d4 turns. If a character's Strength is reduced to 0, the PC dies. If the Strength is reduced to 1 or 2 points, the PC is rendered comatose, only recovering when (and if) sufficient hit points are recovered to raise the Strength to 3 or more. The spirit troll has an acute sense of smell and superior, 120 foot-range, infravision.</p>

					<p>Unicorns dwell only in temperate woodlands, away from human habitation. These fierce but good creatures shun contact with all but sylvan creatures (dryads, pixies, sprites, and the like); however, they will show themselves to defend their woodland home.</p>
					<p>Powerful steeds with gleaming coats of pure white hair, unicorn eyes are usually deep sea blue or fiery pink. Long, silky white strands of hair hang down from the mane and forelock. A single ivory-colored horn, 2 to 3 feet in length, grows from the center of each unicorn's forehead. Males are distinguished by the white beard beneath the chin; females by their more elegant and slimmer musculature. The hooves of a unicorn are cloven and yellow-ivory in color. Unicorns speak their own language as well as those of other sylvan creatures and elves.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Unicorns can sense an enemy from 240 yards away. Likewise, unicorns move very silently, so opponents are penalized -6 on their surprise rolls. Unicorns can kick with their front hooves and thrust with the horn each round. Due to the horn's magical nature, it always has a +2 bonus to hit. Unicorns can charge into battle, using the horn like a lance. To make this charge, there must be at least 30 feet of open space between the unicorn and his opponent. Opponents struck by a charging unicorn suffer <b>3-36 points of damage </b>from impaling. Unicorns may not attack with their front hooves in the round they charge.</p>
					<p>Once per day a unicorn can use a <i>teleport </i>spell of limited range. This spell will transport the unicorn (and its rider) to any place that the unicorn desires, up to 360 yards away. Unicorns often use this ability as a last resort to avoid death or capture.</p>
					<p>In addition, unicorns can never be <i>charmed </i>or <i>held </i>by magic. They are <b><u>immune to death spells and make all saving throws against spells as if they were wizards of 11th level </u></b>. Unicorns are <b><u>immune to poison </u></b>.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Unicorns mate for life and make their home in an open dell of the forest they have chosen to protect. There, in the boles of the trees, unicorns etch a glyph, recognizable to sylvan creatures, indicating that the forest is under unicorn protection. Rangers have a 10% chance per level of determining correctly whether a forest is guarded by unicorns. Once a woodland has a unicorn protector, no other unicorn will enter that forest unless the forest is very large. Each family of unicorns stakes out a territory approximately 400 square miles (20 miles by 20 miles).</p>
					<p>Travelers may pass through a unicorn's forest freely and even hunt there, but anyone killing for sport or damaging the forest maliciously will be attacked if the unicorn is nearby (10% chance). The ferocity of this attack is determined by the evil of the trespasser. Truant youths throwing stones at animals, for example, would be driven off with just a few bruises as a reminder, while pillaging orcs would be hunted down and slain.</p>
					<p>Lone unicorns occasionally allow themselves to be tamed and ridden by a human or elf maiden of pure heart and good alignment. A unicorn that submits once and is treated kindly will act as the maiden's steed for life, even carrying her beyond the realm of his forest if she so desires. Unicorns make exceptionally loyal mounts and will protect their riders even unto death.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Unicorns are herbivores, living on tender leaves and grasses. Their only enemies are griffons and those creatures who destroy forests, in particular red dragons and orcs.</p>
					<p>The life span of unicorns has never been recorded but is known to surpass 1,000 years. They are believed to maintain their youth until death is only weeks away. The secret to this longevity is the strong magical nature of the horn. Unicorn horns are highly sought after, since possession of one is a sovereign remedy against all poisons. Alternately, a single horn can be used, by an alchemist, to manufacture 2-12 <i>potions of healing </i>. Unicorn horns sell for 1,500 gold pieces or more on the open market.</p>

					<p>Of all the chaotic evil undead creatures that stalk the world, none is more dreadful than the vampire. Moving silently through the night, vampires prey upon the living without mercy or compassion. Unless deep underground, they must return to the coffins in which they pass the daylight hours, and even in the former case they must occasionally return to such to rest, for their power is renewed by contact with soil from their graves.</p>
					<p>One aspect that makes the vampire far more fearful than many of its undead kindred is its appearance. Unlike other undead creatures, the vampire can easily pass among normal men without drawing attention to itself for, although its facial features are sharp and feral, they do not seem inhuman. In many cases, a vampire's true nature is revealed only when it attacks.</p>
					<p>There are ways in which a vampire may be detected by the careful observer, however. Vampires cast no reflection in a glass, cast no shadows, and move in complete silence.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>When engaging in combat, vampires are savage and fearsome opponents. They are physically very powerful, with a Strength score of 18/76, receiving a bonus of +2 to hit and +4 to damage. The crushing blows of a vampire's attack are so fierce that they inflict <b>5-10 points of damage </b>.</p>
					<p>The gaze of a vampire is one of its most powerful and dangerous weapons. Any person who allows the vampire to look into his eyes will be affected as if by a <i>charm person </i>spell. <b><u>Due to the power of this enchantment, a -2 is applied to the victim's saving throw vs. spell </u></b>. In this manner, vampires are often able to pass posted sentries and surprise their chosen victims.</p>
					<p>Like all undead creatures, vampires exist in both the Positive Material and Negative Material planes at the same time. Their powerful negative essence allows them to drain two life energy levels from anyone they strike. If the vampire is making use of some form of weapon in the attack, it cannot employ this power.</p>
					<p>Weapons of less than +1 enchantment pass through vampires without harming them in any way. Even if attacked with and harmed by magical weapons, vampires regenerate 3 hit points per round. If reduced to zero hit points, a vampire is not destroyed, but is forced to assume gaseous form. Once in this state, it will attempt to flee and return to its coffin where, after eight hours of rest, it regains its corporeal form. If the defeated vampire is unable to reach its coffin within 12 turns, however, its essence breaks up and the creature is truly destroyed.</p>
					<p><i>Sleep </i>, <i>charm </i>, and <i>hold </i>spells do not affect vampires. Similarly, they are unharmed by poisons and <b><u>immune to paralysis </u></b>. <b><u>Spells that are based on cold or electricity cause only half damage </u></b>.</p>
					<p>At will, vampires are able to disperse their bodies into clouds of elemental vapor and assume <i>gaseous form </i>. In this state, they are all but <b><u>immune to attack and can escape from almost any confinement </u></b>. In addition, vampires can <i>shape change </i>so as to take on the form of a large bat (hence the flying movement rate given above).</p>
					<p>Vampires can summon lesser creatures for aid. In a subterranean environment, they will typically call forth a swarm of 10-100 rats or bats. In the case of the latter, these do not physically attack but serve to confuse and obscure the vision of the vampire's foes. In the wilderness, a vampire will normally call upon 3-18 wolves for assistance. In all cases, the summoned animals arrive in 2-12 rounds.</p>
					<p>At will, a vampire can use a <i>spider climb </i>ability and scale sheer surfaces. Often, they will employ this power to gain access to rooms on upper floors without alerting those on watch downstairs. This power also permits the vampire to seek refuge in places which are all but beyond the reach of mortal men.</p>
					<p>Despite the great powers which vampires obviously possess, they are not without weaknesses of their own. The odor of strong garlic repels them and they will not approach it. Further, they will recoil from the face of a mirror or lawful good holy symbol if either of these is presented to them with courage and conviction. It is important to understand, however, that this will not actually harm the vampire in any way nor drive it off. Garlic will prevent the creature from attacking or entering the area, while mirrors and holy symbols force the vampire to find some means of removing the offending object before it can be bypassed. In most cases, the vampire will seek to overcome these hazards with the aid of its minions. For example, a charmed person might be called upon to attack someone who is holding the vampire at bay with a holy symbol. Another important point to keep in mind is that a lawful good holy symbol will affect the vampire regardless of the vampire's original religious background. Vampires which are splashed with a vial of holy water or struck with lawful good holy symbols are burned by them, suffering <b>2-7 points of damage </b>.</p>
					<p>Just as vampires can be kept at bay, so too can they be slain by those who have the knowledge to do so. Any vampire which is exposed to direct sunlight is instantly rendered powerless and, after one round, utterly annihilated. If the vampire can be immersed in running water, it loses one-third of its hit points each round, until destroyed on the third round. Last, a vampire can be killed by having a wooden stake driven through its heart. In this case, however, the creature can be restored simply by removing the stake if further measures are not taken to ensure the fate of the vampire. In order for it to be completely destroyed, the vampire's head must be cut off and its mouth stuffed with holy wafers (or their equivalent).</p>
					<p>In addition to its aversion to items like garlic and holy symbols, the vampire acts under many other limitations. One of the most powerful of these is the creature's inability to enter a home without being first invited to do so by a resident of the dwelling. This does not apply to public buildings and places of business which, by their very nature, extend an 'invitation' to all. Once a vampire has been invited to enter a residence, it may come and go freely afterward. A common manner for obtaining permission to enter a home is the use of the vampire's gaze to <i>charm </i>a servant or other inhabitant.</p>
					<p>Any human or humanoid creature slain by the life energy drain of a vampire is doomed to become a vampire himself. Thus, those who would hunt these lords of the undead must be very careful lest they find themselves condemned to a fate far worse than death. The transformation takes place one day after the burial of the creature. Those who are not actually buried, however, do not become undead and it is thus traditional that the bodies of a vampire's victims be burned or similarly destroyed. Once they become undead, the new vampire is under the complete control of its killer. If that vampire is destroyed, the controlled undead are freed from its power and become self-willed creatures.</p>
					<p>In most cases, vampires do not lose the abilities and knowledge which they had in life when they become undead. Thus, it is possible for a vampire to have the powers of, for example, a wizard, thief, or even priest. In all cases, of course, the new vampire becomes chaotic evil.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Vampires live in areas of death and desolation where they will not be reminded of the lives they have left behind. Ruined castles or chapels and large cemeteries are popular lairs for them, as are sites of great tragedies or battles. Vampires often feel a strong attachment to specific areas with some morbid significance, like the grave of a suicide or the site of a murder.</p>
					<p>When deciding on a course of action or planning a campaign, vampires move very slowly and meticulously. It is not uncommon for a vampire to undertake some scheme which may take decades or even centuries to reach its conclusion. Because of the curse of immortality that has fallen upon them, they feel that time is always on their side and will often defeat foes who might otherwise overcome them; the vampire can simply go into hiding for a few decades until the passing of the years brings down its enemies.</p>
					<p>Vampires are normally solitary creatures. When they are found in the company of others of their kind, the group will certainly consist of a single vampire lord and a small group of vampires which it has created to do its bidding. In this way, the vampire can exert its power over a greater range without running the risk of exposing itself to attack by would-be heroes.</p>
					<p>In general, vampires feel only contempt for the world and its inhabitants. Denied the pleasures of a true life, they have become dark and twisted creatures bent on revenge and terror. When a vampire creates another of its kind, it considers the new creature a mere tool. The minion will be sent on missions which the vampire feels may be too dangerous or unimportant for its personal attention. If the need arises, these pawns will gladly be sacrificed to protect or further the ends of their master.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>The vampire has no place in the world of living creatures. It is a thing of darkness that exists only to bring about evil and chaos. Almost without exception, the vampire is feared and hated by those who dwell in the regions in which it chooses to make its home. The vampire's unnatural presence is all-pervasive and will cause dogs and similar animals to raise a cry of alarm at the presence of the creature.</p>
					<p>Vampires sustain themselves by draining the life force from living creatures. Unless they have a specific need to create additional minions, however, they are careful to avoid killing those they attack. In cases where the death of a victim is desired, the vampire will take care to see that the body is destroyed and thus will not rise as an undead.</p>
					<p>Vampires are divided into age categories. Essentially, a vampire's power grows as it ages - the creature gains new abilities that it did not previously have and becomes less susceptible. In short, the older a vampire becomes, the more formidable a foe it becomes. Each age category has a title associated with it (ages refer to the number of years the creature has been a vampire).</p>
					<p>These titles are more of an academic interest than any practical value, as one would not normally refer to vampires by any of the above titles. For example, Strahd von Zarovich falls into the 'ancient' category, but one who calls him 'Ancient Strahd', rather than 'Lord Strahd', will not live long to rue to the error.</p>

Although they share many of the western vampire's strengths and weaknesses, they have the ability to fade from sight at will. Once they have become <i>invisible </i>, they receive all of the normal bonuses which such a state normally bestows, including being attacked at -4. These monsters are unable to <i>charm </i>their victims, however, and cannot assume <i>gaseous form </i>at will as western vampires can.</p>

					<p>These horrid creatures are products of the Lower Planes. Though found mainly in the haunted reaches of the Lower Planes, they are sometimes encountered in underground places on the Prime or in the Outlands, such as caverns or the sewers or catacombs of large cities.</p>
					<p>The vargouille has a hideous, humanlike head with batlike wings, fangs, and a crown and fringe of writhing tentacles. Its eyes glow with an eerie green light, and it wears a horrible sneer. Vargouilles do not speak, but they shriek when they attack.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>The sight of a vargouille, combined with its terrifying shriek, causes fear. <b><u>All who view the monster and hear its shriek must save vs. spell; those who fail are paralyzed with fear until attacked by the monster </u></b>. The initial attack on a paralyzed victim always hits. A victim who has been attacked or who has saved against the effect is <b><u>immune to the paralysis for the rest of the encounter </u></b>.</p>
					<p>Vargouilles have 120' infravision. They hate light and seek to extinguish light sources, such as torches and lamps. <i>Continual light </i>and daylight blind the monster, so it avoids these.</p>
					<p><b><u>The bite of a vargouille contains a dreadful poison that prevents normal healing; if a creature's bitten fails to save vs. poison, the bite damage is permanent, unless powerful magic is used </u></b>. A <i>heal </i>spell restores 1d8 hp; <i>regenerate </i>restores 3d8 hp at 1 hp per round; and a carefully worded <i>wish </i>restores all lost hit points or the ability to heal through other means.</p>
					<p>The vargouille can also kiss a paralyzed victim, who then begins a bizarre transformation. In 1d6 hours, the first signs appear, as the victim loses all hair on his or her head. In another 1d6 hours, ears grow long and pointed, teeth become fangs, tentacles sprout from head and chin, and the victim loses 1d6 points each from Intelligence and Charisma. In another 1d6 hours the transformation finishes, and the character's head resembles a vargouille, complete with batlike wings in place of ears. At this point, the head breaks away from the body (which dies), becomes a fully-functional vargouille, and flies off.</p>
					<p>The transformation never ends during daylight hours. A <i>continual light </i>spell can halt the transformation's progress, but not cure it. <i>Cure disease </i>cast by a priest of 7th level or higher reverses the transformation.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Vargouilles usually remain below ground or inside buildings, but they sometimes fly at night in search of prey. In ruins, they appear at dusk and disappear by dawn.</p>
					<p>The vargouille have spread from the Lower Planes by infecting travelers and adventurers with their race-perpetuating disease, and they are now found even in thriving cities. There they usually stay underground, waiting for explorers, rather than risk discovery by flying in view of so many people.</p>
					<p>Vargouilles have no culture beyond their pack mentality; only the strong survive, and the strongest rules. Like some other beasts, they fall upon weak or wounded members of their own pack to finish them off.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Though a vargouille collects no treasure, it also does not remove the bodies or possessions of victims, so there may be a few items of incidental treasure lying about its lair.</p>
					<p>Vargouilles are vicious predators with few natural enemies, though good creatures would like to see them become extinct. They are also sometimes hunted by the friends of victims who transformed into the thing. Vargouilles prefer living prey, but they also eat carrion and weak pack members as well.</p>
					<p>Vargouilles are rumored to be the creations of a powerful wizard named Rozvankee the Strategist. Her particular genius lay in the creation of terror weapons of the worst sort. During a prolonged siege against a neighboring duchy, she created the first nine of the creatures and had them released behind enemy lines. The resulting panic led to morale problems, and her shock troops overwhelmed the enemy. In the fullness of time, Rozvankee grew tired of terrestrial affairs, and upon achieving lichdom she retired to one of the watery layers of the Abyss. There she practices piracy in a three-masted ship made from the bones of her enemies.</p>
					<p>Rozvankee took several hundred vargouilles with her, and she has been known to give small flocks to powerful tanar'ri in exchange for favors and protection. The creatures' one drive is procreation, and so they tend to overrun any area that does not put up organized resistance.</p>
					<p>Some tales report that an upstart sorcerer (with nothing like Rozvankee's talent) found a few shields and banners bearing her family coat of arms. The story goes that he then commanded a flock of vargouilles simply by presenting them the signs to them. He established an effective power base until the lich showed up and dissuaded him from the practice. This legend may or may not be true, but over the years sales of the shields and banners have started many a con man's fortune.</p>

					<p>In ages long past, the word 'wight' meant simply 'man'. As the centuries have passed, though, it has come to be associated only with those undead that typically inhabit barrow mounds and catacombs.</p>
					<p>From a distance, wights can easily be mistaken for any number of humanoid races. Upon closer examination, however, their true nature becomes apparent. As undead creatures, wights are nightmarish reflections of their former selves, with cruel, burning eyes set in mummified flesh over a twisted skeleton with hands that end in sharp claws.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Wights are fierce and deadly foes in combat. When attacked, they are unharmed by any weapons that are not forged from silver or enchanted in some manner.</p>
					<p>The wight attacks with its jagged claws and powerful blows, inflicting <b>1-4 points of damage </b>with each successful strike. In addition to this physical harm, the wight is able to feed on the life essence of its foes. Each blow that the wight lands drains one level from the victim, reducing Hit Dice, class bonuses, spell abilities, and so forth. Thus, a 9th-level wizard struck by a wight loses 1-4 hit points and becomes an 8th-level wizard; he has the spells and hit points of an 8th-level wizard and he fights as an 8th-level wizard.</p>
					<p>Persons who are slain by the energy draining powers of a wight are doomed to rise again as wights under the direct control of their slayer. In their new form, they have the powers and abilities of a normal wight but half their experience levels, class abilities, and Hit Dice. If the wight who 'created' them is slain, they will instantly be freed of its control and gain a portion of its power, acquiring the normal 4+3 Hit Dice of their kind. Once a character becomes a wight, recovery is nearly impossible, requiring a special quest.</p>
					<p>Wights are unaffected by <i>sleep </i>, <i>charm </i>, <i>hold </i>or cold-based spells. In addition, they are not harmed by poisons or paralyzation attacks.</p>
					<p>Wights can be engaged and defeated by individuals who are well prepared for battle with them. Physical contact with holy water is deadly to wights and each vial splashed on one burns it for <b>2-8 points of damage </b>. In addition, a <i>raise dead </i>spell becomes a powerful weapon if used against the wight. Such magic is instantly fatal to the creature, utterly annihilating it.</p>
					<p>Wights cannot tolerate bright light, including sunlight, and avoid it at all costs. It is important to note, however, that wights are not harmed by exposure to sunlight as vampires are.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Like the other undead that infest the world, wights live in barrow mounds, catacombs, and other sepulchral places. They despise light and places which are vibrant with living things. As a rule, the wight is hateful and evil, seeking to satisfy its hatred of life by killing all those it encounters.</p>
					<p>Although wights are often found in small groups, they are actually solitary creatures. Without exception, encounters with multiple wights will be a single leader and a number of lesser creatures which it has created to serve it. In these cases, the leader of the group will be more than willing to sacrifice some or all of its minions to assure its own survival or victory.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Like all undead, wights exist on both the Prime Material and Negative Material planes simultaneously. It is this powerful link to the negative world that gives them their fearsome level-draining ability. Further, it is this draining which provides them with sustenance.</p>
					<p>As they are not living creatures and have no rightful place in our world, many animals can sense the wight's presence. Dogs will growl or howl with alarm, horses will refuse to enter an area which wights inhabit, and birds and insects will grow silent when the creature passes near them. In addition, their presence will gradually cause the plant life around their lairs to wither and die, marking the region as unclean.</p>

					<p>The will o'wisp is a malevolent entity that makes its home in swamps, bogs, and moors. It subsists by luring unsuspecting creatures to their deaths amid the natural hazards of such places and feeding on the energies which their death struggles release.</p>
					<p>When encountered in the wild, will o'wisps normally appear as faintly glowing balls of light. They can alter their own color, shape, and size to some extent and can be easily mistaken for lanterns, <i>light </i>spells, and similar sources of artificial illumination.</p>
					<p>If they do not attack, will o'wisps are able to utterly blank out their glows, rendering them invisible to all those who cannot spot invisible objects, for 2-8 melee rounds.</p>
					<p>The will o'wisp language is a most unusual one, being purely optical in nature. All communication between will o'wisps is by means of changes in color or brightness, many of which are far too subtle for the average observer to notice. Because this form of exchange is almost impossible to mimic, it is very difficult for travelers to communicate with these creatures. Exceptional examples of this race have mastered a very simple sound-based language. They produce sounds by vibrating very rapidly and thus have a shallow and ghostly-sounding voice when they 'speak'.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>As a rule, will o'wisps seek to avoid physical combat with other creatures, preferring to lead them to their deaths in the swamps around them instead. When pressed, however, they are dangerous adversaries who must be attacked with the greatest care. In combat, they glow blue, violet, or pale green.</p>
					<p>Will o'wisps are very versatile flyers. They can hover in place without effort, often looking like lanterns or similar beacons to lure others toward them. When they decide to move, they can do so with rapid bursts of speed or slow drifting movements.</p>
					<p>A will o'wisp's main weapon in combat is its ability to manifest a powerful electric charge. In melee, it swoops at its foe and attempts to brush against the victim, discharging the stored energy. A successful strike by one of these creatures will cause <b>2-16 points of damage </b>.</p>
					<p>Those attacking a will o'wisp with any form of physical weapon are able to inflict damage normally. Persons making use of magical attacks, however, will find their powers almost ineffective against them. As a rule, the only spells which have any effect on the will o'wisp are <i>protection from evil </i>, <i>magic missile </i>, and <i>maze </i>. A will o'wisp which is reduced to 5 or fewer hit points will attempt to escape. If it is unable to flee, the creature will surrender to its attackers and attempt to buy its safety by offering up any treasure which it may have. It is important to note, however, that the chaotic alignment of the will o'wisp can make any agreement with the creature uncertain.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>For the most part, will o'wisps will be found on their own. On rare occasions (10% of the time) groups of up to three may be found near a particularly fertile hunting ground. In the latter case, they will work together to trick victims into the traps which they have arranged.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Although difficult to say with certainty, evidence indicates that the will o'wisp feeds on the fury of electrical activity given off by the brains of panic stricken individuals as they realize that death is inescapable. In order to prolong the suffering of their victims and increase the amount of 'food' which they give off, will o'wisps will typically lure their victims into areas like quicksand pits which promise a slow and frightening death.</p>
					<p>It seems certain that the unusual environment found in bogs and swamps is important to the creature's existence in some way, but the exact nature of this link is uncertain. It seems probable that the ominous and haunting nature of these places increases the fear and dread which their victims feel, and thus the energy which they give off prior to death.</p>

					<p>The wolf is a very active, cunning carnivore, capable of surviving in nearly every climate. Shrouded in mystery and suspicion, they are viewed as vicious killers that slaughter men and animals alike for the lack of better things to do. The truth is that never in recorded history has a non-rabid or non-charmed wolf attacked any creature having an equal or higher intellect than itself. (The chance of encountering a rabid wolf that would attack anything is 1%, if a lone wolf is encountered.)</p>
					<p>Northern wolves exhibit colors from pure white, to grey, to black. Southern wolves are reddish and brown in color. Although fur coloration vary with climate, all wolves have various features in common. They are characterized by powerful jaws; wide strong teeth; bushy tails; tall, strong ears; and round pupils. Their eyes, a gold or amber color, seem to have an almost empathic ability.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Wolves hunt in packs during winter and late fall when only large herbivores are available. Wolves prefer small prey over the larger variety, because of the amount of energy required to run them down. Even then, they catch only the weak and sickly animals. Wolves usually hunt only one large quarry per week, per pack, going without food for days at a time. During summer months, a single wolf can consume over 30 mice in a single day.</p>
					<p>If a wolf or wolf pack is attacked by humans, they run away, looking back momentarily to make sure they are not being followed. If backed into an inescapable location, they will attack by tearing at clothing or legs and arms until they have an opening to escape.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Wolves, like humans and demi-humans, are social animals. They live, hunt and play in families. There is a very strict social structure in these family groups that is continually followed. Each pack is led by an alpha male; his mate is the alpha female. Only the alpha male and alpha female breed, but the second ranking female often helps in whelping and nursing duties.</p>
					<p>Wolves prefer areas not inhabited by other large predators. Their domain has many terrain features in which they can play. Large rocks, fallen trees, and brooks play an important part in their recreational activities. Wolves will leave an area once humans move in.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Wolves are valuable hunters in the wild. Fear of the wolf has resulted in their extinction in many areas. This genocide results in a marked increase in rodents and deer population that has nearly demolished the surrounding ecosystems.</p>
					<p><b>Dire Wolf</b></p>
					<p>The dire wolf is an ancestor of the modern species. Though larger in size, they are otherwise similar to their descendants.</p>
					<p><b>Worg</b></p>
					<p>Worgs are an offshoot of dire wolf stock that have attained a degree of intelligence and a tendency toward evil. Worgs have a primitive language and often serve as mounts of goblins.</p>
					<p><b>Winter Wolf</b></p>
					<p>The most dangerous member of the species, the winter wolf is known for its great size and foul disposition. Living only in chill regions, they can unleash a stream of frost from their lungs once every 10 rounds, causing <b>6d4 points of damage </b>to everything within 10 feet. <b><u>A save vs. breath weapon is allowed for half damage </u></b>. Cold-based attacks to not harm the winter wolf, but fire-based attacks cause an additional point of damage, per die of damage.</p>
					<p>Winter wolves are more intelligent than their cousins and, in addition to being able to communicate with worgs, have a fairly sophisticated language of their own.</p>
					<p>The winter wolf is beautiful, with glistening white or silver fur and eyes of pale blue or silver. If in good condition, a pelt is worth 5,000 gold pieces.</p>

					<p>The wolf is a very active, cunning carnivore, capable of surviving in nearly every climate. Shrouded in mystery and suspicion, they are viewed as vicious killers that slaughter men and animals alike for the lack of better things to do. The truth is that never in recorded history has a non-rabid or non-charmed wolf attacked any creature having an equal or higher intellect than itself. (The chance of encountering a rabid wolf that would attack anything is 1%, if a lone wolf is encountered.)</p>
					<p>Northern wolves exhibit colors from pure white, to grey, to black. Southern wolves are reddish and brown in color. Although fur coloration vary with climate, all wolves have various features in common. They are characterized by powerful jaws; wide strong teeth; bushy tails; tall, strong ears; and round pupils. Their eyes, a gold or amber color, seem to have an almost empathic ability.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Wolves hunt in packs during winter and late fall when only large herbivores are available. Wolves prefer small prey over the larger variety, because of the amount of energy required to run them down. Even then, they catch only the weak and sickly animals. Wolves usually hunt only one large quarry per week, per pack, going without food for days at a time. During summer months, a single wolf can consume over 30 mice in a single day.</p>
					<p>If a wolf or wolf pack is attacked by humans, they run away, looking back momentarily to make sure they are not being followed. If backed into an inescapable location, they will attack by tearing at clothing or legs and arms until they have an opening to escape.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Wolves, like humans and demi-humans, are social animals. They live, hunt and play in families. There is a very strict social structure in these family groups that is continually followed. Each pack is led by an alpha male; his mate is the alpha female. Only the alpha male and alpha female breed, but the second ranking female often helps in whelping and nursing duties.</p>
					<p>Wolves prefer areas not inhabited by other large predators. Their domain has many terrain features in which they can play. Large rocks, fallen trees, and brooks play an important part in their recreational activities. Wolves will leave an area once humans move in.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Wolves are valuable hunters in the wild. Fear of the wolf has resulted in their extinction in many areas. This genocide results in a marked increase in rodents and deer population that has nearly demolished the surrounding ecosystems.</p>
					<p><b>Dire Wolf</b></p>
					<p>The dire wolf is an ancestor of the modern species. Though larger in size, they are otherwise similar to their descendants.</p>
					<p><b>Worg</b></p>
					<p>Worgs are an offshoot of dire wolf stock that have attained a degree of intelligence and a tendency toward evil. Worgs have a primitive language and often serve as mounts of goblins.</p>
					<p><b>Winter Wolf</b></p>
					<p>The most dangerous member of the species, the winter wolf is known for its great size and foul disposition. Living only in chill regions, they can unleash a stream of frost from their lungs once every 10 rounds, causing <b>6d4 points of damage </b>to everything within 10 feet. <b><u>A save vs. breath weapon is allowed for half damage </u></b>. Cold-based attacks to not harm the winter wolf, but fire-based attacks cause an additional point of damage, per die of damage.</p>
					<p>Winter wolves are more intelligent than their cousins and, in addition to being able to communicate with worgs, have a fairly sophisticated language of their own.</p>
					<p>The winter wolf is beautiful, with glistening white or silver fur and eyes of pale blue or silver. If in good condition, a pelt is worth 5,000 gold pieces.</p>

					<p>Though they vary widely in size, all the worms in this listing have some common characteristics. They are all burrowers with long, cylindrical shapes.</p>
					<p><b>Purple Worm</b></p>
					<p>A constant threat to subterranean explorers, the purple worm burrows through the earth in search of prey. The worm is sensitive to minute vibrations in the earth, and can sense prey at a range of 60 feet. Adult purple worms as large as 8-9 feet in diameter and 140-150 feet long have been reliably reported.</p>
					<p>The worm attacks by biting; an attack roll that exceeds the required score to hit by 4 or more indicates the victim has been swallowed whole. This worm can devour creatures up to 8 feet tall and 6 feet wide. A swallowed creature dies in six rounds, is digested in two hours, and cannot be raised from the dead.</p>
					<p>Anyone trapped inside a purple worm may attempt to cut their way out. The interior is AC 9, but digestive juices weaken the victim, causing a cumulative -1 penalty to the damage the victim can cause.</p>
					<p>This worm has a stinger on its tail. <b><u>Anyone hit by the stinger suffers 2d4 points of damage </u></b><u>and must make a successful saving throw vs. poison or be slain instantly </u>.</p>
					<p>The purple worm is solitary and seeks a companion only to mate. The moment a new worm hatches, it burrows into the ground, never to be seen by its siblings again. As the worm tunnels, it consumes vast amounts of material that are excreted when it returns to its lair. Among the discharged substances are precious metals and gems.</p>
					<p>The <i>mottled worm </i>is an aquatic variety of the purple worm. It inhabits shallow bottom muck, but it often surfaces to search for prey. Otherwise, it is the same as a purple worm.</p>
					<p>The <i>thunderherder </i>is desert variety of the purple worm; they travel in herds of 10-100, several feet under the sands. They feed on small creatures in the sand, their bodies ejecting sand. They are 3-5 feet in diameter and 5-10 feet long, and have 7 Hit Dice. Their mouths are unable to cause damage, but their passage beneath an area causes an earthquake-like effect.</p>
					<p><b>Giant Bloodworm</b></p>
					<p>These worms are mottled green in color, with a dark, slimy, brown underbelly. A giant bloodworm attacks when hungry or when stepped on, by trying to fasten its mouth to its victim. If it hits, it causes <b>1d8 damage </b>, and continues to cause <b>1d8 damage </b>per round from blood drain, until killed or removed (removal requires a successful open doors roll).</p>
					<p>These worms are especially vulnerable to fire, taking double normal damage from such attacks, or full damage when they make a successful saving throw despite a -2 penalty to the roll.</p>
					<p><b>Bookworm</b></p>
					<p>This worm can change its normal gray color to match its surroundings; opponents suffer a -6 to surprise rolls. Bookworms inhabit libraries, eating through the pages and bindings found there. They cannot eat living matter, but they will burrow through dead wood, leather, and other normal book materials at a rate of 3 inches per round. They are very fast and seek to avoid capture and combat when discovered.</p>
					<p><b>Rot Grub</b></p>
					<p>These maggot-like creatures live in refuse. If they touch exposed skin (they have a percentage chance to do this equal to the victim's AC, not counting shield), they burrow into the flesh and secrete a mild poison that deadens the burrowing area; a victim must make a successful Wisdom check to notice the burrowing; one check is allowed each round. Fire kills 2d10 grubs per application to infested flesh, but after 1d6 rounds they are too deep to be burned. A <i>cure disease </i>will kill the rot grubs. If the worms are not stopped, they reach the heart in 1d3 turns, killing the victim.</p>

					<p>The wraith is an evil undead spirit of a powerful human that seeks to absorb human life energy.</p>
					<p>These horrible creatures are usually seen as black, vaguely man-shaped clouds. They have no true substance, but tend to shape themselves with two upper limbs, a torso, and a head with two glowing red eyes. This shape is a convenience born from the habit of once having a human body.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>The touch of a wraith does damage in two ways. First, the chilling effect of the touch inflicts <b>1-6 points of damage </b>, even to creatures <b><u>immune to cold </u></b>. Second, such a hit drains a level of experience from its victim. This includes hit points and all abilities associated with that level, such as spell casting or combat ability. The damage from the chill can be healed normally, but the experience points are gone forever and must be earned again or magically <i>restored </i>.</p>
					<p>Wraiths are <b><u>immune to normal weapons </u></b>. An attack with such a weapon merely passes through its body with no effect. <b><u>Silver weapons cause only half normal damage </u></b>. Magical weapons inflict their full damage, causing a black vapor to boil away from the body of the wraith. A wraith slowly regains its full hit points if left alone for at least a week (recovering one point every eight hours). Like most undead, wraiths are <b><u>immune to </u></b><b><i><u>sleep </u></i></b><b><u>, </u></b><b><i><u>charm </u></i></b><b><u>, </u></b><b><i><u>hold </u></i></b><b><u>, death and cold-based spells </u></b>. They are <b><u>immune to poison and paralyzation </u></b>. A vial of holy water causes <b>2-8 points of damage </b>(as acid) upon striking the body of a wraith. <b><u>A </u></b><b><i><u>raise dead </u></i></b><b><u>spell will utterly destroy one if a saving throw vs. spell is failed </u></b>.</p>
					<p>Wraiths attack humans or demihumans in preference to other creatures. However, animals will sense their presence within 30 feet and refuse to advance further, panicking if forced. A pack of wraiths will try to get surprise when attacking, and will wait and position themselves for the most advantageous moment to attack. Wraiths are very intelligent and tend to cluster around the weaker members, or stragglers, when attacking. Any human killed by a wraith becomes a half-strength wraith under its control (e.g., a 10th-level fighter will become a 5 Hit Die wraith under the control of the wraith that slew him).</p>
					<p>This foul creature has no power in direct sunlight and will flee from it. Sunlight cannot destroy the wraith, but the undead creature cannot attack in sunlight. It shuns bright (e.g., <i>continual </i>) light sources in general, but will occasionally attack if the compulsion to do so is strong.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>A wraith is an undead spirit of a powerful, evil human. As such, it is usually found in tombs or places where such men and women would have died. Since such men and women are frequently buried together, in the case of the wealthy, or with their families, wraiths are most commonly encountered in packs. Those that died or were buried alone might still be encountered in packs, because a human who dies from the touch of a wraith becomes a wraith under the sway of its slayer. The treasure of the wraith is usually its possessions in life, now buried with it, or those of its victims. Wraiths exist only to perpetuate evil by absorbing the life force of as many people as possible. A character who becomes a wraith is nearly impossible to recover, requiring a special quest.</p>
					<p>The wraith cannot communicate, except through a <i>speak with dead </i>spell. They do not even seem to communicate with each other, except as master to slave for combat strategy. Any attempt to speak to a wraith is met with scorn, unless by a very powerful party. In that case, the wraith desires only to flee. Wraiths can be dominated by powerful evil creatures, particularly other undead, priests, and wizards, and made to serve their will.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>The wraith has no proper niche, serving no useful purpose in nature and providing no byproducts that others can use. It requires no nourishment, killing only for the sheer hatred of life. All creatures close to nature will shun the presence of a wraith. It exists more in the Negative Material Plane than in the Prime Material Plane, and thus is not a natural part of this world.</p>

					<p>A distant cousin to the dragon, the wyvern is a huge flying lizard with a poisonous stinger in its tail.</p>
					<p>The 35-foot-long dark brown to gray body of the wyvern is half tail. Its leathery batlike wings are over 50 feet from tip to tip. The head alone is 4 feet long and filled with long, sharp teeth. Unlike the dragon, it has only hind legs, using them the same way a hunting bird would. The tip of the tail is a thick knot of cartilage from which a 2- foot-long stinger protrudes, very much like that of a scorpion. The eyes are red or orange. A wyvern does not have a strong odor, although its lair might smell of a recent kill. These beasts can make two sounds: a loud hiss, which sounds like a hot sword plunged into water, and a low, deep-throated growl, much like that of a bull crocodile.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Rather stupid, but aggressive, wyverns will nearly always attack. In combat, the wyvern always prefers to be flying, and will seize any opportunity to take flight and continue combat. If trapped on the ground it will bite ( <b>2-16 points of damage </b>) and use its stinger ( <b>1-6 points of damage </b>), attacking the most convenient target or targets. The tail is very mobile, easily striking over the back of the wyvern to hit an opponent to its front. <b><u>The stinger injects poison (type F) into the wound, against which the victim must make a save vs. poison or die </u></b>. Even if the saving throw is successful, the victim suffers 1-6 points of physical damage from the sting.</p>
					<p>From the air the wyvern is a far more deadly opponent. It dives upon ground targets, attempting to snatch them up in its two taloned claws ( <b>1-6 points of damage </b>each) and fly off. Man-sized victims are snatched if at least one talon hits for damage. Large victims require both talons to hit in order to snatch them up. The wyvern cannot fly while carrying anything bigger. After a dive, it takes the wyvern a full round to circle around. On the next round it can dive again. Once airborne with prey in its talons, the wyvern stings and bites each round, both at +4 to hit, until the victim is motionless. In aerial combat, the wyvern will make a pass during which it will either bite or sting. Then it will land and feast, not hunting again until the next day.</p>
					<p>As a hunter, the wyvern is cunning. It will avoid letting its shadow fall across its prey as a warning. The final approach of the dive is done in complete silence, imposing a -2 surprise modifier on the target. It trails its prey from downwind whenever possible. A mature wyvern often waits for the right moment to strike, and is willing to let prey go that is too powerful or within easy reach of cover. Such a wyvern understands that men, particularly those armed in bright metal, are stronger than their size would indicate. Given a perfect opportunity, it will attempt to snatch up an unarmored member and fly out of range.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>The wyvern is a solitary creature, nesting only with its mate and young. It tends to lair on mountainsides that overlook forests, jungles, or sometimes plains. A wyvern makes its lair in large caverns that can be found in such places, staking out a territory about 25 miles across. If game is sparse, it will hunt with a small group of its own kind. Only young wyverns attack others of their kind, usually to establish new territory. Older wyverns settle disputes in an unknown manner without actual combat.</p>
					<p>Some wyverns have been known to work with evil dragons. Usually these dragons completely dominate the weaker and smaller wyverns.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>An adult wyvern consumes the equivalent of a man-sized to large creature once per day. This could translate to a horse, pig, or a handful of sheep. While it eats them whole, the bones are not digested, and neither are metal objects. The wyvern eats carrion only if desperate.</p>
					<p>The wyvern has no natural enemies, although it would not be a match for certain powerful creatures. It is noted for the foul taste of its flesh. No one has found a way to cure its hide and the bones are light and brittle to aid in flying. Certain body parts are used by spell casters as spell components, for which they will pay a reasonable price.</p>

					<p>The vaguely reptilian xill are natives of the Ethereal Plane. Four-armed, leathery-skinned humanoids brilliantly colored red by some strange twist of fate, these beings are feared on all planes that border the Ethereal (in other words, the Prime and the Inner Planes). 'Course, some xill claim that these fears are unfounded, but peery members of other races believe that even the so-called civilized xill harbor a dark secret.</p>
					<p>All xill communicate telepathically - fact is, they have no spoken language - and they can travel back and forth from the Ethereal Plane (via the Border Ethereal) as they wish.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Less sophisticated xill attack with their four claws when in battle, inflicting <b>1d4 points of damage </b>per strike. Xill of more civilized clans use well-forged weapons. They can wield them in all four hands and often use at least one missile weapon for long-range combat.</p>
					<p>Barbaric xill prefer to attack opponents on planes that 'touch' the Misty Shore. From the Border Ethereal, they slip between the folds to reach the target plane, where they usually startle their intended victims (the sods roll for surprise at -6). The invading xill attack not to kill but to subdue their foes, using two arms to grapple and two to punch.</p>
					<p>Here's how it works: If two of the xill's claws successfully strike a foe (inflicting <b>1d4 points of damage </b>each), the creature automatically puts the victim in a wrestling hold. Then, the xill's other two arms make nonlethal punch attacks (refer to the rules for punching and wrestling in the combat chapter of the <i>PHB </i>or <i>DMG </i>). Once the xill has successfully grappled the opponent, it automatically bites him in the following round. <b><u>The bite inflicts no damage but forces the victim to make a saving throw versus poison or face paralyzation for 1d4 hours </u></b>. (The xill produces enough venom for only two bites every six hours, and it can't bite a foe that it hasn't grappled.)</p>
					<p>If this occurs off the Ethereal, the xill then tries to spirit its paralyzed prey back to its home plane. This process of fading from one spot and reappearing in another takes two rounds, during which time the creature is completely immobile and foregoes its magic resistance. However, as the xill fades, it becomes harder and harder to strike (it's AC -1 in the first round of planar transfer and AC -3 in the second). Once it reaches its Ethereal lair, it implants its paralyzed victim with eggs (as explained below).</p>
					<p>Xill of the High Clans use the paralyzation venom only as a last resort. Because they've let the associated glands atrophy, they produce only enough venom for one bite each day. Certain High Clan xill can become clerics of up to 5th level; these bloods worship a variety of deities.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Xill can be classified as members of the Lower Clans or the High Clans. Lower Clan xill rarely use weapons, preferring the strength of their claws, and they never create anything of their own. They seemingly live only to reproduce, and thus raid other planes looking for intelligent hosts for their eggs. Interestingly, the xill of the Lower Clans don't refer to themselves as 'Lower Clans', don't even acknowledge the High Clans, and can't look upon any other race as anything more than prey. If encountered on the Ethereal, Lower Clan xill are likely to flee after first securing the safety of their young and any prisoners serving as egg hatcheries.</p>
					<p>High Clan xill lead more sophisticated lives, crafting tools, weapons, clothing, and other necessities for themselves. The High Clans rarely leve the Ethereal, but if they're encountered by planewalkers, they don't automatically size up the situation as predator/prey. In fact, many High Clan xill trade goods and information with travelers to the Misty Shore. Cutters looking for such xill can find them in the Deep Ethereal, dwelling in refined cities built on chunks of what's known as solid ether. Some High Clan xill can even be paid to serve as guides to the mysterious plane.</p>
					<p>Chant is, however, that the High Clans xill still need to use intelligent creatures as hosts in which to hatch their young. According to these dark rumors, somewhere hidden in the Deep Ethereal is a vast hatchery/nursery where human slaves are bred and grown like cattle to serve as hosts for xill eggs. These poor sods're supposedly the descendants if victims captured long ago and kept as living prisoners rather than implanted with eggs - for just such a long-term plan. The modern slaves, if they eist, are said to have lost all traces of intelligence or sophistication, and rarely live beyond their late teens before serving as htcheries. Most folk hope that this rumor isn't true and try not to think about it too much.</p>
					<p>In any event, a canny blood should always keep in mind that despite their sophistication, High Clan xill are still evil - vengeful, selfish, sometimes backbiting, and always power-hungry.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Xill live for approximately 50 years, reproducing twice during that time. To do so, they must impant their eggs in a living, intelligent host - only a live body provides the sustenance that the young creatures will need when born.</p>
					<p>The eggs take four days to hatch (during which time a <i>cure disease </i>spell will remove the infestation), after which the larvae begin to eat their way out of their host. This horrible process takes another seven days (at this point, only a <i>wish </i>or <i>limited wish </i>can save the victim), during which time the host suffers <b>1d10+10 points of damage </b>each day. Eventually, 2d8 young xill emerge from the victim, killing him instantly if he's not in the dead-bokk already.</p>

					<p>The xorn are natives to the elemental plane of Earth.</p>
					<p>The wide body of a xorn is made of a pebbly, stone-like material. It has a large, powerful mouth on top of its head with three long arms, tipped with sharp talons, symmetrically positioned every 120 degrees around it. Between the arms are large, stone-lidded eyes that see in all directions. At its base are three thick, short legs, each directly beneath an eye. The whole body is designed for burrowing, mouth first.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Xorn do not attack flesh creatures except to defend themselves or their property, since they can not digest flesh. Xorn have no excessive love or hate for creatures of the Prime Material plane. The sole exception to this is anyone carrying a significant amount of precious metals or minerals, which it can smell up to 20 feet away. The normally peaceful xorn can become quite aggressive when after food, especially on the Prime Material plane, where such sustenance is harder to find than it is on its native plane. Xorn expect to be given a reasonable portion in exchange for peaceful passage, or else they attack (90% chance) to get food.</p>
					<p>In combat, xorn have two different methods of fighting. Against a single opponent, they bend the two legs nearest the opponent deeply, angling their bodies toward the enemy. In this way all four attacks can be brought to bear. Against several opponents, they attack with arms in all directions, each striking at a different target. One of the targets suffers a second attack, as the xorn angles its body down to bite.</p>
					<p>If necessary, a xorn can use its ability to blend into the surrounding stone to impose a -5 penalty to opponents' surprise rolls when it attacks. This incorporates a blending of coloration and its physical ability to pass into and through stone. This does not happen very often, since a xorn is more likely to ignore a party, or openly demand metals. However, once combat begins, it can use a variation on this theme. The xorn may pass through the nearest stone (usually the floor) and vanish for 1-3 rounds. It then lunges out of a stone surface to gain surprise, often at the feet of an opponent, attacking with three arms and its mouth. This guerrilla warfare can continue indefinitely. During any round that it passes through stone, a <i>phase door </i>spell kills it instantly. If fight goes against it, the xorn retreats to the nearest stone surface.</p>
					<p>A xorn is <b><u>immune to fire and cold, both magical and normal </u></b>. Electrical attacks cause half damage if the xorn fails its saving throw, and no damage if the saving throw is successful. <b><u>Edged weapons cause only half damage to xorn, though blunt and piercing weapons do full damage </u></b>. A <i>move earth </i>spell flings a xorn back 30 feet, and the creature is stunned for one round. A <i>stone to flesh </i>or rock to mud spell lowers its AC to 8 for one round. During that round the xorn will attack, as it is readjusting its substance back to stone. Lastly, a <i>passwall </i>spell inflicts <b>1d10+10 points of damage </b>on a xorn.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>A xorn is normally found on the elemental plane of Earth. It is only on the Prime Material plane if forcibly summoned or if it was the victim of an interplanar accident.</p>
					<p>On their native plane, xorn are as peaceful as Prime Material plane herbivores. While xorn are intelligent, their society is limited to small clans of mineral gatherers. These clans wander from place to place, leaving behind open pockets where they have eaten out a vein of mineral. On the Prime Material plane they always seek wide regions of stone underground. What humans would consider treasures, xorn consider food. They keep their store of food in a nearby air pockets.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>On the Prime Material plane, they are visitors that serve no ecological function. On their own plane, they are gatherers, eating only stone and minerals. The empty pockets in the stone are quickly inhabited by various creatures of the plane. Dao have been known to hunt them for sport. Equally as often, xorn serve dao as slaves.</p>
					<p><b>Xaren</b></p>
					<p>Xaren are relatives of the xorn, with identical abilities in combat. Xaren resemble xorn closely, though they are slightly smaller and their hides are shinier, almost metallic. Unlike ordinary xorn, they crave magical metal as food. For each plus of enchantment they eat, they permanently gain 1 hit point, up to their maximum of 45. Even after reaching their maximum growth, they still require magical metal to maintain their health. They can smell magical metal up to 40 feet away.</p>
					<p>Like xorn, xaren expect handouts. They demand magical metal from creatures with enchanted weapons or armor, and attack if they are denied. They prefer iron, copper, silver, gold and electrum (in that order), though they will also snack on metallic ore.</p>
					<p>If attacked with a magical weapon, xaren can make an attack roll against AC -2 to bite an opponent's weapon. <b><u>If they hit, the weapon must save vs. crushing blow or be destroyed </u></b>.</p>
					<p>Xaren and xorn are indifferent to one another and rarely cooperate. Dao do not enslave xaren, though they do hunt them.</p>

					<p>Zombies are mindless, animated corpses controlled by their creators, usually evil wizards or priests.</p>
					<p>The condition of the corpse is not changed by the animating spell. If the body was missing a limb, the zombie created from it would be missing the same limb. Since it is difficult to get fresh bodies, most zombies are in sorry shape, usually missing hair and flesh, and sometimes even bones. This affects their movement, making it jerky and uneven. Usually zombies wear the clothing they died (or were buried) in. The rotting stench from a zombie might be noticeable up to 100 feet away, depending upon the condition of the body. Zombies cannot talk, being mindless, but have been known to utter a low moan when unable to complete an assigned task.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p></p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Zombies move very slowly, always striking last in a combat round. They are given only simple, single-phrase commands. They always fight until called off or destroyed, and nothing short of a priest can turn them back. They move in a straight line toward their opponents, with arms outstretched, seeking to claw or pummel their victims to death. Like most undead, zombies are <b><u>immune to </u></b><b><i><u>sleep </u></i></b><b><u>, </u></b><b><i><u>charm </u></i></b><b><u>, </u></b><b><i><u>hold </u></i></b><b><u>, death magic, poisons, and cold-based spells </u></b>. A vial of holy water inflicts <b>2-8 points of damage </b>to a zombie.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p></p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Zombies are typically found near graveyards, dungeons, and similar charnel places. They follow the spoken commands of their creator, as given on the spot or previously, of limited length and uncomplicated meaning (a dozen simple words or so). The dead body of any humanoid creature can be made into a zombie.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p></p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Zombies are not natural creations and have no role in ecology or nature.</p>
					<p><b>Ju-Ju Zombie</b></p>
					<p>These creatures are made when a wizard drains the life force from a man-sized humanoid creature with an <i>energy drain </i>spell. Their skin is hard, gray, and leathery. Ju-ju zombies have a spark of intelligence. A hateful light burns in their eyes, as they realize their condition and wish to destroy living things. They understand full-sentence instructions with conditions, and use simple tactics and strategies. Since they became zombies at the moment of death, their bodies tend to be in better condition. Ju-ju zombies use normal initiative rules to determine when they strike. They are dexterous enough to use normal weapons, although they must be specifically commanded to do so. These zombies can hurl weapons like javelins or spears, and can fire bows and crossbows. Their Dexterity allows them to climb walls as a thief (92%) and they strike as a 6 Hit Die monster. Ju-ju zombies are turned as specters.</p>
					<p>The animating force of a ju-ju zombie is more strongly tied to the Negative Material plane. The result is that only <b><u>+1 or better magical weapons can harm them </u></b>. Regardless of the magic on the weapon, edged and cleaving weapons inflict normal damage, while blunt and piercing weapons cause half damage. In addition to normal zombie spell immunities, ju-ju zombies are <b><u>immune to mind affecting spells and psionics, illusions, and to electricity and </u></b><b><i><u>magic missiles </u></i></b>. <b><u>Fire causes only half damage </u></b>.</p>
					<p><b>Zombie Lord</b></p>
					<p>The zombie lord is a living creature that has taken on the foul powers and abilities of the undead. They are formed on rare occasions as the result of a <i>raise dead </i>spell gone awry. Zombie lords look as they did in life, save that their skin has turned to the pale grey of death, and their flesh is rotting and decaying. The odor of vile corruption and rotting meat hangs about them, and carrion feeding insects often buzz about them to dine on the bits of flesh and ichor that drop from their bodies.</p>
					<p>The zombie lords can speak those languages they knew in life and they seem to have a telepathic or mystical ability to converse freely with the living dead. Further, they can <i>speak with dead </i>merely by touching a corpse. Zombie lords are turned as vampires.</p>
					<p>When forced into combat, it relies on the great strength of its two crushing fists. The odor of death surrounding the zombie lord is so potent it causes horrible effects in those who breathe it. <b><u>On the first round a character comes within 30 yards, he must save vs. poison or be affected in some way </u></b>. The following results are possible:</p>
					<table>
						<tr>
							<td>1d6 Roll</td>
							<td>Effect</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>1</td>
							<td><i>Weakness </i>(as the spell).</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>2</td>
							<td><i>Cause disease </i>(as the spell).</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>3</td>
							<td>-1 point of Constitution.</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>4</td>
							<td><i>Contagion </i>(as the spell).</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>5</td>
							<td>Character unable to act for 1d4 rounds due to nausea and vomiting.</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>6</td>
							<td>Character dies instantly and becomes a zombie under control of the zombie lord.</td>
						</tr>
					</table>
					<p>All zombies within sight of the zombie lord are subject to its mental instructions. Further, the creature can use the senses of any zombie within a mile of it to learn all that is happening within a very large area.</p>
					<p>Once per day, the zombie lord can <i>animate dead </i>to transform dead creatures into zombies. This works as described in the <i>Player's Handbook </i>except that it can be used on the living. Any living creature with fewer Hit Dice than the zombie lord can be attacked in this manner. <b><u>A target who fails a saving throw vs. death is slain </u></b>. In 1d4 rounds, the slain creature rises as a zombie under the zombie lord's command.</p>
					<p>Zombie lords seek out places of death as lairs. Often, they live in old graveyards or on the site of a tremendous battle - any place there may be bodies to animate and feast upon. The mind of the zombie lord tends to focus on death and the creation of more undead. The regions around their lairs are often littered with the decaying bodies, half eaten, of those who have tried to confront the foul beast.</p>
					<p>The zombie lord comes into being by chance, and only under certain conditions. First, an evil human must die at the hand of an undead creatures. Second, an attempt to raise the character must be made. Third, the corpse must fail its resurrection survival roll. Fourth and last, a deity of evil must show 'favor' to the deceased, and curse him or her with the 'gift of eternal life'. Within one week of the raise attempt, the corpse awakens as a zombie lord.</p>
					<p><b>Sea Zombie</b></p>
					<p>Sea zombies (also known as drowned ones) are the animated corpses of humans who died at sea. Although similar to land-dwelling zombies, they are free-willed and are rumored to be animated by the will of the god Nerull the Reaper (or another similar evil deity).</p>
					<p>The appearance of drowned ones matches their name: they look like human corpses that have been underwater for some time; bloated and discolored flesh dripping with foul water, empty eye-sockets, tongue frequently protruding from between blackened lips. <b><u>Their visage and the stench of decay surrounding them are so disgusting that anyone seeing a drowned one or coming within 20 feet of one must roll a saving throw vs. poison </u></b>. A failed saving throw indicates that the character is nauseated, suffering a -1 penalty to his attack roll and a +1 penalty to his AC for 2d4 rounds. On land, drowned ones move slowly, with a clumsy, shambling gait. In water, however, they can swim with frightening speed.</p>
					<p>Drowned ones have an abiding hatred for the living and attack them at any opportunity. These attacks often show surprising cunning (for example, luring ships onto the rocks and attacking the sailors as they try to save themselves from the wreck). Drowned ones take advantage of their swimming speed by attacking ships as they lie at anchor - climbing aboard the vessel and trying to drive the sailors overboard, where they can deal with them more easily.</p>
					<p>Drowned ones attack with the weapons typical of sailors: short swords, daggers, hooks, clubs, belaying pins, etc. Because of the unnatural strength of the creatures, these weapons all inflict <b>1d10 points of damage </b>. The putrid water that drips from the drowned ones contains many bacteria, so any successful hit has a 10% chance of causing a severe disease in the victim. <b><u>The water-logged condition of the creature's flesh means that fire and fire-based magic cause only half damage </u></b>. Lightning, electrical, and cold-based attacks inflict double damage. Drowned ones are <b><u>immune to </u></b><b><i><u>sleep </u></i></b><b><u>, </u></b><b><i><u>charm </u></i></b><b><u>spells, illusions, and other mind-altering spells </u></b>. Because they are created by the direct will of a deity, they cannot be turned.</p>
					<p>Many of the humans who become drowned ones were priests while alive, and they retain their powers as undead. There is a 50% chance that each drowned one encountered is a priest of level 1d4. These creatures are granted their spells directly from Nerull (or similar deity), receiving only baneful spells.</p>
					<p>Drowned ones congregate in loose packs. Their only motivation is their hatred for the living. They have no need to eat, although they rend and chew the flesh of their prey (this is probably just to strike terror in others). Underwater, drowned ones are active around the clock and are often found in the sunken wrecks of the ships in which they drowned. They are active above the surface during the night. Drowned ones normally stray no more than 100 yards from the water. If the wind drives the fog onto the coast, however, they can roam inland as far as the fog reaches. When the fog retreats, or when the sun is about to rise, they must return to the water.</p>
					<p>Drowned ones communicate among themselves by a form of telepathy; they have no need of a spoken language (other than for spellcasting). The verbal components for spells are spoken in unintelligible whispers.</p>

The odor of death surrounding the zombie lord is so potent it causes horrible effects in those who breathe it. <b><u>On the first round a character comes within 30 yards, he must save vs. poison or be affected in some way </u></b>. The following results are possible:</p>
					<table>
						<tr>
							<td>1d6 Roll</td>
							<td>Effect</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>1</td>
							<td><i>Weakness </i>(as the spell).</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>2</td>
							<td><i>Cause disease </i>(as the spell).</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>3</td>
							<td>-1 point of Constitution.</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>4</td>
							<td><i>Contagion </i>(as the spell).</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>5</td>
							<td>Character unable to act for 1d4 rounds due to nausea and vomiting.</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>6</td>
							<td>Character dies instantly and becomes a zombie under control of the zombie lord.</td>
						</tr>
					</table>
					<p>All zombies within sight of the zombie lord are subject to its mental instructions. Further, the creature can use the senses of any zombie within a mile of it to learn all that is happening within a very large area.</p>
					<p>Once per day, the zombie lord can <i>animate dead </i>to transform dead creatures into zombies. This works as described in the <i>Player's Handbook </i>except that it can be used on the living. Any living creature with fewer Hit Dice than the zombie lord can be attacked in this manner. <b><u>A target who fails a saving throw vs. death is slain </u></b>. In 1d4 rounds, the slain creature rises as a zombie under the zombie lord's command.</p>
					<p>Zombie lords seek out places of death as lairs. Often, they live in old graveyards or on the site of a tremendous battle - any place there may be bodies to animate and feast upon. The mind of the zombie lord tends to focus on death and the creation of more undead. The regions around their lairs are often littered with the decaying bodies, half eaten, of those who have tried to confront the foul beast.</p>
					<p>The zombie lord comes into being by chance, and only under certain conditions. First, an evil human must die at the hand of an undead creatures. Second, an attempt to raise the character must be made. Third, the corpse must fail its resurrection survival roll. Fourth and last, a deity of evil must show 'favor' to the deceased, and curse him or her with the 'gift of eternal life'. Within one week of the raise attempt, the corpse awakens as a zombie lord.</p>
					<p><b>Sea Zombie</b></p>
					<p>Sea zombies (also known as drowned ones) are the animated corpses of humans who died at sea. Although similar to land-dwelling zombies, they are free-willed and are rumored to be animated by the will of the god Nerull the Reaper (or another similar evil deity).</p>
					<p>The appearance of drowned ones matches their name: they look like human corpses that have been underwater for some time; bloated and discolored flesh dripping with foul water, empty eye-sockets, tongue frequently protruding from between blackened lips. <b><u>Their visage and the stench of decay surrounding them are so disgusting that anyone seeing a drowned one or coming within 20 feet of one must roll a saving throw vs. poison </u></b>. A failed saving throw indicates that the character is nauseated, suffering a -1 penalty to his attack roll and a +1 penalty to his AC for 2d4 rounds. On land, drowned ones move slowly, with a clumsy, shambling gait. In water, however, they can swim with frightening speed.</p>
					<p>Drowned ones have an abiding hatred for the living and attack them at any opportunity. These attacks often show surprising cunning (for example, luring ships onto the rocks and attacking the sailors as they try to save themselves from the wreck). Drowned ones take advantage of their swimming speed by attacking ships as they lie at anchor - climbing aboard the vessel and trying to drive the sailors overboard, where they can deal with them more easily.</p>
					<p>Drowned ones attack with the weapons typical of sailors: short swords, daggers, hooks, clubs, belaying pins, etc. Because of the unnatural strength of the creatures, these weapons all inflict <b>1d10 points of damage </b>. The putrid water that drips from the drowned ones contains many bacteria, so any successful hit has a 10% chance of causing a severe disease in the victim. <b><u>The water-logged condition of the creature's flesh means that fire and fire-based magic cause only half damage </u></b>. Lightning, electrical, and cold-based attacks inflict double damage. Drowned ones are <b><u>immune to </u></b><b><i><u>sleep </u></i></b><b><u>, </u></b><b><i><u>charm </u></i></b><b><u>spells, illusions, and other mind-altering spells </u></b>. Because they are created by the direct will of a deity, they cannot be turned.</p>
					<p>Many of the humans who become drowned ones were priests while alive, and they retain their powers as undead. There is a 50% chance that each drowned one encountered is a priest of level 1d4. These creatures are granted their spells directly from Nerull (or similar deity), receiving only baneful spells.</p>
					<p>Drowned ones congregate in loose packs. Their only motivation is their hatred for the living. They have no need to eat, although they rend and chew the flesh of their prey (this is probably just to strike terror in others). Underwater, drowned ones are active around the clock and are often found in the sunken wrecks of the ships in which they drowned. They are active above the surface during the night. Drowned ones normally stray no more than 100 yards from the water. If the wind drives the fog onto the coast, however, they can roam inland as far as the fog reaches. When the fog retreats, or when the sun is about to rise, they must return to the water.</p>
					<p>Drowned ones communicate among themselves by a form of telepathy; they have no need of a spoken language (other than for spellcasting). The verbal components for spells are spoken in unintelligible whispers.</p>

					<p>Smaller than wolves, the appearance of the wild dog varies from place to place. Most appear very wolf-like, while others seem to combine the looks of a wolf and a jackal.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Wild dogs fight as an organized pack. They favor small game, and attack men and human habitations only in times of great hunger. The bite of a wild dog inflicts <b>1-4 points of damage </b>.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Wild dogs are found almost anywhere. They run in packs, and are led by the dominant male. The pack usually hunts a variety of game, even attacking deer or antelope. Pups are born in the spring. Wild dogs can be tamed if separated from their pack.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Wild dogs are omnivores which usually thrive on a combination of hunting and foraging.</p>
					<p><b>War Dogs</b></p>
					<p>Generally large mastiffs or wolfhounds, they have keen senses of smell and hearing, making them adept at detecting intruders. Most war dogs are not usually vicious, and will rarely attack without cause. The status of war dogs varies greatly; some are loyal and beloved pets, some are watch dogs, others are hunting dogs, and some are trained for battle.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Blink Dogs</b></p>
					<p>Blink dogs are yellowish brown canines which are stockier and more muscular than other wild dogs. They are intelligent and employ a limited form of teleportation when they hunt.</p>
					<p>A blink dog attack is well organized. They will blink to and fro without any obvious pattern, using their powers to position themselves for an attack. Fully 75% of the time they are able to attack their targets from the rear. A dog will teleport on a roll of 7 or better on a 12-sided die. To determine where the dog appears, roll a 12-sided die: 1 = in front of opponent, 2 = shielded (or left) front flank, 3 = unshielded (or right) front flank, 4-12 = behind. When blinking, the dog will appear from 1 to 3 feet from its opponent and will immediately be able to attack.</p>
					<p>Blinking is an innate power and the animal will never appear inside a space occupied by a solid object. If seriously threatened, the entire pack will blink out and not return.</p>
					<p>Blink dogs are intelligent, and communicate in a complex language of barks, yaps, whines, and growls. They inhabit open plains and avoid human haunts. A lair will contain 3-12 (3d4) pups 50% of the time (1-2 hit dice, 1-2/1-3 hit points damage/attack). These puppies can be trained and are worth between 1,000 to 2,000 gold pieces.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Death dog</b></p>
					<p>Death dogs are large two-headed hounds which are distinguished by their penetrating double bark. Death dogs hunt in large packs.</p>
					<p>Each head is independent, and a bite does <b>1-10 points of damage </b>. <b><u>Victims must save vs. poison or contract a rotting disease which will kill them in 4-24 (4d6) days </u></b>. Only a cure disease spell can save them. A natural roll of 19 or 20 on their attack die means that a man-sized opponent is knocked prone and attacks at a -4 until able to rise to its feet again. There is an 85% chance that death dogs will attack humans on sight.</p>

					<p>Small cousins of the dwarves, gnomes are friendly but reticent, quick to help their friends but rarely seen by other races unless they want to be. They tend to dwell underground in hilly, wooded regions where they can pursue their interests in peace. Gnomes can be fighters or priests, but most prefer to become thieves or illusionists instead. Multi-class characters are more common among the gnomes than any other demihuman race.</p>
					<p>Gnomes strongly resemble small, thin, nimble dwarves, with the exception of two notable facial features: gnomes prefer to keep their beards short and stylishly-trimmed, and they take pride in their enormous noses (often fully twice the size of any dwarf or human's). Skin, hair, and eye color vary somewhat by subrace: the most common type of gnome, the Rock Gnome, has skin ranging from a dark tan to a woody brown (sometimes with a hint of gray), pale hair, and eyes any shade of blue. Gnomish clothing tends toward leather and earth tones, brightened by a bit of intricately wrought jewelry or stitching. Rock gnomes have an average life span of around 450 years, although some live to be 600 years or more.</p>
					<p>Gnomes speak their own language, and each subrace has its own distinctive dialect. Many gnomes learn the tongues of humans, kobolds, goblins, halflings, and dwarves in order to communicate with their neighbors, and some Rock Gnomes are able to communicate with burrowing mammals via a basic language of grunts, snorts, and signs.</p>
					<p>Gnomes posses infravision to 60 feet, and the ability to detect sloping passages (1-5 on 1d6), unsafe stonework (1-7 on 1d10), and approximate depth (1-4 on 1d6) and direction (1-3 on 1d6) underground. They are highly <b><u>resistant to magic, gaining a +1 bonus to their saving throws for each 3 </u></b>.5 points of Constitution (a typical gnome will have a bonus of +3 to +4). Unfortunately, this also means that there is a 20% chance that any magical item a gnome attempts to use will malfunction (armor, weapons, and illusionary items exempted).</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Gnomes prefer the use of strategy over brute force in combat and will often use illusions in imaginative ways to 'even the odds\xA8. Their great hatred of kobolds and goblins, their traditional enemies, gives them a+1 on their attack rolls when fighting these beings. They are adept at dodging the attacks of large opponents, forcing all giant class creatures (gnolls, bugbears, ogres, trolls, giants, etc.) to subtract 4 from their attack rolls when fighting gnomes.</p>
					<p>Gnomes can use any weapon that matches their size and often carry a second (or even a third) weapon as a back-up. Short swords, hammers, and spears are favorite melee weapons, with short bows, crossbows, slings, and darts coming into play when distance weapons are called for; virtually every gnome will also carry a sharp knife somewhere on his or her person as a final line of defense.</p>
					<p>A typical rock gnome will wear studded leather armor and use a small shield (AC 6). Their leaders will have chain mail (AC 4), and any gnome above 5th level has plate mail (AC 2). There is a 10% chance for each level above 5th that the gnome's armor and/or weapon is magical (roll separately for each). Spell casters have a 10% chance per level of having 1-3 magical items usable by their character class.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Gnomes live in underground burrows in remote hilly, wooded regions. They are clannish, with friendly rivalries occurring between neighboring clans. They spend their lives mining, crafting fine jewelry, and enjoying the fruits of their labors. Gnomes work hard, and they play hard. They observe many festivals and holidays, which usually involve games, nose measuring contests, and swapping of grand tales. Their society is well organized, with many levels of responsibility, culminating in a single chief who is advised by clerics in matters directly relating to their calling.</p>
					<p>A gnomish lair is home to some 40-400 (4d10&#62;010) gnomes, one-quarter of them children. For every 40 adults there is a fighter of 2nd to 4th level. If 160 or more are encountered there is also a 5th-level chief and a 3rd-level lieutenant. If 200 or more are met, there is a cleric or illusionist of 4th to 6th level. If 320 or more are present, add a 6th-level fighter, two 5th-level fighters, a 7th-level cleric, four 3rd-level clerics, a 5th-level illusionist, and two 2nd-level illusionists.</p>
					<p>Gnomes often befriend burrowing mammals, so 5d6 badgers (70%), 3d4 giant badgers (20%), or 2d4 wolverines (10%) will be present as well. These animals are neither pets nor servants, but allies who will help guard the clan.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Gnomes are very much a magical part of nature, existing in harmony with the land they inhabit. They choose to live underground but remain near the surface in order to enjoy its beauty.</p>
					<p><b>Svirfneblin (Deep Gnome)</b></p>
					<p>Far beneath the surface of the earth dwell the Svirfneblin, or Deep Gnomes. Small parties of these demihumans roam the Underdark's mazes of small passageways searching for gemstones. They are said to dwell in great cities consisting of a closely connected series of tunnels, buildings, and caverns in which up to a thousand of these diminutive creatures live. They keep the location of these hidden cities secret in order to protect them from their deadly foes, the kuo-toa, Drow, and mind flayers.</p>
					<p>Svirfneblin are slightly smaller than rock gnomes, but their thin, wiry, gnarled frames are just as strong. Their skin is rock-colored, usually medium brown to brownish gray, and their eyes are gray. Male svirfneblin are completely bald; female deep gnomes have stringy gray hair. The average svirfneblin life span is 250 years.</p>
					<p>Svirfneblin mining teams and patrols work together so smoothly that to outside observers they appear to communicate with each other by some form of racial empathy. They speak their own dialect of gnomish that other gnomish subraces are 60% likely to understand. Most deep gnomes are also able to converse in Underworld Common and speak and understand a fair amount of kuo-toan and drow. These small folk can also converse with any creature from the elemental plane of Earth via a curious 'language' consisting solely of vibrations (each pitch conveys a different message), although only on a very basic level.</p>
					<p>All svirfneblin have the innate ability to cast blindness, blur, and change self once per day. Deep gnomes also radiate non-detection identical to the spell of the same name. Deep gnomes have 120-foot infravision, as well as all the detection abilities of rock gnomes. (See also Wizard Spells, Player's Handbook)</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Despite their metal armor and arms, these quick, small folk are able to move very quietly. Deep gnomes are able to 'freeze' in place for long periods without any hint of movement, making them 60% unlikely to be seen by any observer, even those with infravision. They are surprised only on a roll of 1 on 1d10 due to their keen hearing and smelling abilities and surprise opponents 90% of the time.</p>
					<p>The deep gnomes wear leather jacks sewn with rings or scales of mithral steel alloy over fine chainmail shirts, giving a typical svirfneblin warrior an Armor Class of 2. They do not usually carry shields, since these would hinder movement through the narrow corridors they favor. For every level above 3rd, a Deep Gnome's Armor Class improves by one point - a 4th-level deep gnome has AC 1, a 5th-level deep gnome, AC 0; to a maximum of AC 6.</p>
					<p>All deep gnomes are 20% magic resistant, gaining an extra +5% magic resistance for each level they attain above 3rd. They are <b><u>immune to illusions, phantasms, and hallucinations </u></b>. Because of their high wisdom, speed, and agility, they make all saving throws at +3, except against poison, when their bonus is +2.</p>
					<p>Deep Gnomes are typically armed with a pick and a dagger which, while nonmagical, gain a +1 bonus to attacks and damage due to their finely-honed edges. Svirfneblin also carry 1d4+6 special stun darts, throwing them to a range of 40 feet, with a +2 bonus to hit. <b><u>Each dart releases a small puff of gas when it strikes; any creature inhaling the gas must save vs. poison or be stunned for 1 round and slowed for the next four rounds </u></b>. Elite warriors (3rd level and above) often carry hollow darts with acid inside (+2d4 to damage) and crystal caltrops which, when stepped on, release a powerful sleep gas.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Svirfneblin society is strictly divided between the sexes: females are in charge of food production and running the city, while males patrol its borders and mine for precious stones. A svirfneblin city will have both a king and a queen, each of whom is independent and has his or her own sphere of responsibility. Since only males ever leave the city, the vast majority of encounters will be with deep gnome mining parties seeking for new lodes. For every four svirfneblin encountered, there will be an overseer with 4+7 Hit Dice. Groups of more than 20 will be led by a burrow warden (6+9 Hit Dice) with two 5th-level assistants (5+8 Hit Dice).</p>
					<p>It is 25% probable that a 6th-level deep gnome will have illusionist abilities of 5th, 6th, or 7th level. Deep Gnomes who are not illusionists gain the ability at 6th level to summon an earth elemental (50% chance of success) once per day.</p>
					<p>Deep gnome clerics have no ability to turn undead.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Stealth, cleverness, and tenacity enable the svirfneblin to survive in the extremely hostile environment of the Underdark. They love gems, especially rubies, and will take great risks in order to gain them. Their affinity for stone is such that creatures from the elemental plane of Earth are 90% unlikely to harm a deep gnome, though they might demand a hefty tithe in gems or precious metals for allowing the gnome to escape.</p>
					<p><b>Tinker Gnome (Minoi)</b></p>
					<p>Cheerful, industrious, and inept, tinker gnomes originated on Krynn, but they have spread to many other worlds via spelljamming ships. Physically similar to rock gnomes, even to the extent of sharing the same infravision range, magic resistance, combat bonuses, and detection abilities, their history and culture are so radically different as to qualify them for consideration as a separate subrace.</p>
					<p>Graceful and quick in their movements, tinker gnomes' hands are deft and sure. Tinkers have rich brown skin, white hair, and china-blue or violet eyes. Males favor oddly-styled beards and moustaches, and both sexes have rounded ears and typically large gnomish noses. Tinkers who avoid getting blown up in an experiment live for 250-300 years.</p>
					<p>Tinker gnomes speak very rapidly, running their words together in sentences that never seem to end. They are capable of talking and listening at the same time: when two tinkers meet, they babble away, answering questions asked by the other as part of the same continuous sentence.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Tinker gnomes rarely carry weapons, although some of their ever present tools can be pressed into service at need. However, they delight in invention and are always devising strange weapons of dubious utility, from the three barrel water blaster to the multiple spear flinger. Tinkers can wear any type of armor but typically outfit themselves in a variety of mismatched pieces for an effective AC of 5.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Tinker gnomes establish colonies consisting of immense tunnel complexes in secluded mountain ranges. The largest gnome settlement on Krynn, beneath Mount Nevermind, is home to some 59,000 tinkers. Other tinker gnome colonies exist, both on Krynn and elsewhere, but their populations seldom exceed 200-400.</p>
					<p>All tinkers have a Life Quest: to attain perfect understanding of a single device. Few ever actually attain this goal, but their individual Life Quests do keep the ever hopeful tinkers busy. Males and females are equal in tinker society, and each pursue Life Quests with similar devotion. Each tinker gnome belongs to a guild. The guild occupies the same place in a tinker's life that the clan occupies for other gnomes. Together the guildmasters make up a grand council that governs the community.</p>
					<p>Though most tinker gnomes are content to stay home and tinker with their projects, some have Life Quests which require them to venture out into the world. Adventuring gnomes are generally unable to learn from past experience and repeat the same mistakes, yet they are often successful with quirky solutions to save the day for their companions.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Despite their great friendliness, tinker gnomes are not well-liked by other races: their technological bent makes them quite alien to those accustomed to magic, and their poor understanding of social relations puts off many potential friends. Sages generally agree that the tinkers' indiscriminate trumpeting of technology has discouraged its development by other races who have encountered tinker gnomes.</p>
					<p><b>Forest Gnome</b></p>
					<p>Shy and elusive, the forest gnomes live deep in forests and shun contact with other races except in times of dire emergencies threatening their beloved woods. The smallest of all the gnomes, they average 2 to 21/2 feet in height, with bark-colored, gray-green skin, dark hair, and blue, brown, or green eyes. A very long-lived people, they have an average life expectancy of 500 years.</p>
					<p>In addition to their own gnomish dialect, most forest gnomes can speak gnome common (rock gnome), Elf, Treant, and a simple language that enables them to communicate on a very basic level with forest animals. All forest gnomes have the innate ability to <i>pass without trace </i>, hide in woodlands (90% chance of success), and the same saving throw bonus as their rock gnome cousins.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Forest gnomes prefer boobie traps and missile weapons to melee weapons when dealing with enemies. Due to size and quickness they receive a -4 bonus to Armor Class whenever they are fighting M- or L-sized opponents. Forest gnomes receive a +1 bonus to all attack and damage rolls when fighting orcs, lizardmen, troglodytes, or any creature which they have seen damage their forest.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Forest gnomes live in small villages of less than 100 gnomes, each family occupying a large, hollowed-out tree. Most of these villages are disguised so well that even an elf or a ranger could walk through one without realizing it.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Forest gnomes are guardians of the woods and friends to the animals that live there. They will often help lost travellers but will strive to remain unseen while doing so.</p>

					<p>The oozes, slimes and jellies of the underworld are hideous, amorphous creatures that are the bane of all that lives, dissolving the weapons, armor, and flesh of their victims.</p>
					<p><b>Ochre Jelly</b></p>
					<p>This monster resembles a giant amoeba, seeping through darkened corridors, through cracks and under doors, searching for flesh or cellulose to devour. Their form allows them to travel on walls and ceilings and drop on unsuspecting prey.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>The ochre jelly attacks by attempting to envelop its prey. Its secretions dissolve flesh, inflicting 3-12 (d10+2) points of damage per round of exposure. While a <i>lightning bolt </i>will divide the creature into one or more smaller jellies, each doing one-half normal damage, fire- and cold-based attacks have normal effects.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>An asexual creature, the ochre jelly is a solitary beast that is occasionally found with its own divided offspring. It lives only to eat and reproduce.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Voraciously dissolving all types of carrion and trash, this monster is sometimes tolerated in inhabited subterranean areas for its janitorial services, but this activity is difficult to organize and is usually not appreciated by the inhabitants because of its danger.</p>

					<p>A slimy horror that looks like wet stone or a sedimentary rock formation, the gray ooze is rarely thicker than six or eight inches, but sometimes grows to a length of 12 feet. It cannot climb walls or ceilings, so it slides, drips, and oozes along cavern floors.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>The gray ooze strikes like a snake, and can corrode metal at an alarming rate (chain mail in one round, plate mail in two, and magical armor in one round per each plus to Armor Class). Spells have no effect on this monster, nor do fire- or cold-based attacks. Lightning and blows from weapons cause full damage. Note that weapons striking a gray ooze may corrode and break.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>After a large meal, a gray ooze reproduces by 'budding': growing a small pod that is left behind in a corridor or cavern. This pod takes two to three days to mature and then the little gray ooze absorbs its leathery shell and begins slithering about, searching for a meal. Sometimes more than one of these monsters are found together, but this is just a random event because they are not intelligent.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>The gray ooze is a dungeon scavenger. It is rumored that metalworkers of extraordinary skill keep very small oozes in stone jars to etch and score their metal work, but this is a delicate and dangerous practice.</p>
					<p><b>Crystal Ooze</b></p>
					<p>This creature is a variety of gray ooze which has adapted to living in water. It is 75% invisible when immersed in its natural element. It is translucent, mostly glassy clear, with an occasional milky white swirl in its substance.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Crystal ooze strikes like a snake, then attempts to flow over a victim and exude its paralyzing poison. Unlike its cousin, the gray ooze, this creature does not corrode metal, but its poisons attack wood, cloth, and flesh. Unless a victim successfully saves vs. poison, he becomes paralyzed and will be consumed by the crystal ooze in a short time. When prey is reduced to -20 hit points, it is totally consumed. Crystal ooze cannot be harmed by acid, cold, heat, or fire attacks, but electricity and <i>magic missiles </i>inflict full damage. Blows from weapons inflict only 1 point of damage per hit. <b><u>A wooden weapon must save vs. acid or it will dissolve and break </u></b>.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Crystal oozes live in any dim or dark body of water, though they can exist out of water for several hours. They reproduce by budding, like the gray ooze, but the crystal pods usually take seven to 10 days to hatch. Crystal oozes will eat their offspring, but occasionally, if the body of water is large enough and food is not scarce, a few of them might be found living in the same water.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Crystal oozes are scavengers that leave metal and stone objects in their wake, so incidental treasure can often be found around and in their lairs.</p>
					<p><b>Gelatinous Cube</b></p>
					<p>So nearly transparent that they are difficult to see, these cubes travel down dungeon corridors, absorbing carrion and trash along the way. Their sides glisten, tending to leave a slimy trail, but gelatinous cubes cannot climb walls or cling to ceilings. Very large cubes grow tall to garner mosses and the like from ceilings.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>A gelatinous cube attacks by touching its victim with its anesthetizing slime. <b><u>A victim who fails to save vs. paralyzation is paralyzed (anesthetized) for 5-20 (5d4) rounds </u></b>. The cube then surrounds its prey and secretes digestive fluids to absorb the food. All damage is caused by these digestive acids. Because gelatinous cubes are difficult to see, others are -3 on their surprise roll. Electricity, <i>fear </i>, <i>holds </i>, paralyzation, <i>polymorph </i>, and sleep-based attacks have no effect on this monster, but fire and blows from weapons have normal effects. If a cube fails its saving throw against a cold-based attack, the cube will be slowed 50% and inflicts only <b>1-4 points of damage </b>.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Possessing no intelligence, gelatinous cubes live only for eating. They prefer well- traveled dungeons where there is always food to scavenge. These creatures reproduce by budding, leaving clear, rubbery cubes in dark corners or on heaps of trash. Young are not protected and are sometimes reabsorbed by the parent. Treasure is sometimes swept up by a gelatinous cube as the creature travels along a cavern floor; any metals, gems, or jewelry are carried in the monster's body until they can be ejected as indigestible. Items found inside a cube include treasure types J, K, L, M, N, Q, as well as an occasional potion, dagger, or similar object.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>The gelatinous cube is sometimes encouraged to stay in a certain area for its scavenging abilities, and is preferred over other jellies and oozes since its square shape does not allow it to slither under doors and into areas in which it is not desired.</p>
					<p><b>Green Slime</b></p>
					<p>A hideous growth, green slime is bright green, sticky, and wet. It grows in dark subterranean places on walls, ceilings and floors.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>This slime cannot attack but is sensitive to vibrations and often drops from the ceiling onto a passing victim. Green slime attaches itself to living flesh and in 1-4 melee rounds turns the creature into green slime (no resurrection possible). Green slime eats through one inch of wood in an hour, but can dissolve metal quickly, going through plate armor in three melee rounds. The horrid growth can be scraped off quickly, cut away, frozen, or burned. A <i>cure disease </i>spell kills green slime, but other attacks, including weapons and spells, have no effect.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Green slime hates light and feeds on animal, vegetable, and metallic substances in dark caverns. Since it cannot move, this slime grows only when food comes to it. Sunlight dries it out and eventually kills it. Occasional huge slimes or colonies of dozens have been reported.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Green slime is an infestation that all creatures avoid; it is burned out of caverns or mines if found. Once it has infected an area, it has a tendency to grow back, even after being frozen or burned away, because dormant spores can germinate years later.</p>

					<p>The lammasu, a winged leonine figure with a human head, aids and protects lawful good persons. They are generally kind and friendly to all good creatures.</p>
					<p>Lammasu resemble golden-brown lions with the wings of eagles and the heads of men with shaggy hair and beards. Their formidable appearance is softened by their regal, compassionate, and beneficent expressions. They communicate in their own tongue, in common, and through a limited form of telepathy.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Since lammasu are concerned for the welfare and safety of good beings, they almost always enter combat if they see good creatures being threatened, in the way least likely to cause harm to the good beings.</p>
					<p>Lammasu are able to become <i>invisible </i>or <i>dimension door </i>at will. They radiate a <i>protection from evil, 10' radius </i>(-2 penalty to all evil attacks, +2 bonus to saving throws against evil attacks). Additionally, they are able to use priest spells up to 4th level, at 7th-level proficiency. Lammasu can employ four 1st-level spells, three 2nd-level spells, two 3rd-level spells, and one 4th-level spell. They have <i>cure serious wounds </i>(4d8+2) and <i>cure critical wounds </i>(6d8+6), and 10% of lammasu can speak a <i>holy word </i>as well.</p>
					<p>If all else fails, lammasu can attack with their two razor-sharp front claws, inflicting <b>1d6 points of damage </b>each. If they choose to swoop down from the sky on a target, this damage is doubled.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>The lammasu have a very structured and lawful society, reflecting their alignment. They are organized in prides, just like lions. They dwell in old, abandoned temples situated in warm regions. These temples have not lost their consecration, and in some way, the lammasu are the self-appointed resident guardians of these high and holy places. As a rule, only one pride of lammasu is ever found in a 25-mile area; they spread themselves out so they can respond quickly to any evil outburst.</p>
					<p>Lammasu females fight as effectively as the males; for every four lammasu encountered, one is a female. When found in their lair, there are young equal to 25% of the adult population. Female lammasu have the heads of women, with long, hair.</p>
					<p>Once a month, the pride leaders gather together to consort about how the war on evil goes. This grouping is called the Whitemoon, since it takes place on the first night of the full moon. There are usually 6d6 lammasu and 2d4 greater lammasu, with the latter presiding over the meeting. Such a gathering of lawful good causes the entire temple where they meet to glow in a pure light, until it breaks up at dawn. There is perhaps no safer place in all the world that night.</p>
					<p>Though they dwell in warm areas, they occasionally visit every clime. They speak their own tongue as well as common. At times they use a limited form of telepathy.</p>
					<p>Good-aligned strangers are always well received. Neutrals are watched carefully, but are treated politely unless the outsiders begin causing trouble. Evil beings are firmly asked to leave, and if they fail to do so, they are attacked by the pride. In case of trouble, there is a cumulative 10% chance per turn that a neighboring pride picks up a telepathic summons and come to help out the original pride. Lammasu harbor an especially strong dislike for lamias and manticores. Some foolish people confuse lammasu for manticores, which does little to improve the lammasu disposition toward them.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Lammasu keep the wastelands from being completely overrun by evil creatures. Their aid to frontier settlements is beyond measurable value.</p>
					<p><b>Greater Lammasu</b></p>
					<p>These creatures are slightly larger than a lesser lammasu and one or two may be found dwelling with a pride of six or more lesser lammasu. Greater lammasu can travel the Astral and Ethereal Planes, become <i>invisible </i>, <i>teleport without error </i>and <i>dimension door </i>, all at will. They radiate <i>protection from evil in a 20' radius </i>(-4 penalty to evil attacks and +4 bonus to saving throws) and have the curative powers of their lesser cousins. Their priest spells consist of five 1st-level, four 2nd-level, three 3rd-level, two 4th-level, and one 5th-level spell. Fifty percent of greater lammasu can speak a holy word as well. They cast spells as 12th-level priests.</p>
					<p>Greater lammasu have empathy, telepathic communication, and speak their racial speech and the common tongue. Despite their greater stature, these lammasu are just as gentle and humble as their lesser brethren.</p>

					<p>Mimics are magically-created creatures with a hard rock-like outer shell that protects their soft inner organs. Mimics can alter their form and their pigmentation; they use this talent to lure victims into close range, where they attempt to feed on them. They usually appear in the form of treasure chests. There are two varieties, the smaller, more intelligent common mimic, and the larger, less intelligent killer mimic.</p>
					<p>Mimics are large. Common mimics occupy about 150 cubic feet (a 3'x6'x8' chest, or a large door frame). Killer mimics occupy about 200 cubic feet. Mimics' natural color is a speckled grey that resembles granite. Mimics can alter their pigmentation to resemble varieties of stone (such as marble), wood grain, and various metals (gold, silver, copper); it takes one round to make the desired alteration. They cannot lose mass in this transformation (they must remain the same size, though they may radically alter their dimensions).</p>
					<p>Common mimics have their own tongue (corruptions of the original language spoken by their wizard creators) and can also be taught to speak in common and other languages. Killer mimics are incapable of speech.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>A mimic can surprise its victims easily (-4 penalty to victims' surprise rolls). When a creature touches a mimic, it lashes out with a pseudopod that inflicts <b>3d4 points of damage </b>. Furthermore, the mimic covers itself with a glue-like substance. Any creature or item that touches a mimic is held fast. Alcohol will weaken the glue in three rounds, enabling the character to break free, or the character may attempt to make an open doors roll to break free. Only one attempt may be made per character, and no other action, offensive or defensive, may be performed during the round that the attempt is being made. A mimic may neutralize its glue at any time that it desires; the glue dissolves five rounds after the mimic dies. The mimic is <b><u>immune to acid attacks and is unaffected by molds, green slime, and various puddings </u></b>.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Mimics live underground, where they can avoid sunlight. They are solitary creatures; this is to ensure that each mimic has a large grazing area. They have no culture; their primary concerns are survival and food. Common mimics are quite intelligent and will gladly offer information in exchange for food. Killer mimics attack regardless of attempts at communication. Mimics have no moral code and no interest in culture or religion. Wizards who use them as guardians have sometimes found them to be less than enthusiastic about obeying their commands.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Mimics were originally created by wizards to protect themselves from treasure hunters. A good meal (one or two humans) can sustain them for weeks. They reproduce by fission and grow to full size in several years. Mimics pose as stonework, doors, statues, stairs, chests, or other common items made from stone, wood, and metal. Their skin is covered with optical sensors that are sensitive to heat and light in a 90-foot radius, even in pitch darkness. Any powerful light source can easily blind them, including direct sunlight. Along with glue, they can excrete a liquid that smells like rotting meat; this attracts smaller, more common prey (usually rats). Mimic ichor is useful in the creation of polymorph self potions, and their glue and solvent sacs can be sold to alchemists. Other internal organs are useful in the manufacture of perfumes. The mimic's internal organs are considered tasty delicacies in some cultures.</p>

					<p>Nightshades, or <i>wood woses </i>, are the elemental spirits of poisonous plants like mistletoe, hemlock, foxglove, and belladonna. They live in dark, unhallowed forests and caverns.</p>
					<p>Nightshades oddly resemble sylvan dwarves with dark brown skin, stocky but supple, as flexible as reeds or willows. Their thick beards and thatch-like hair are full of vines and leaves. They wear only kilts and vests of woven fibers. They carry weapons of beaten copper or bronze. They speak their own tongue, the languages of plants and fungi, and the language of quicklings.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>In combat, nightshades wield bronze spears or short swords. They are <b><u>immune to wooden weapons like clubs, bo sticks, and staves; even magical shillelaghs or enchanted staves are useless </u></b>. Nightshades suffer double damage from fire.</p>
					<p>Wood woses use their sap to poison blades, though the poison becomes inactive after 10 rounds of contact with air. <b><u>It takes one round to poison a blade, and, unless the victim makes a saving throw versus poison, the poison reduces the victim's dexterity by 1 </u></b>. When a victim's dexterity drops below 3, he is rendered immobile. When it is less than 1, he dies, to sprout as a nightshade the following full moon.</p>
					<p>Striking a wood wose with a claw, fist, or kick is dangerous; their stinging poison does 1-4 hp damage to the attacker. Creatures grasped and held by a nightshade for a round lose a point of dexterity and suffer 2-5 hp damage.</p>
					<p>Nightshades can <i>speak with plants </i>and <i>pass without trace </i>at will, and use <i>entangle </i>and <i>plant door </i>1 time per day. In groups of six or more there is always a nightshade mage, who has the spell powers of a 5th-level druid. A group of seven or more nightshades can summon a shambling mound once per month. To recite the magic words of the summoning spell, the wood woses must first drink blood. The summoning takes six turns; thereafter the nightshades command the shambling mound all night.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Nightshades in the wild are elusive nighttime hunters. By day they retreat into hollow logs, caverns, or other dark places to hide from the sun. They mate for life, though most mated pairs produce no more than two offspring.</p>
					<p>Nightshade outposts take the form of dark, echoing groves. They dwell in small foraging groups and are semi-nomadic, leaving their groves when the forest is silent. They grow rings of poisonous plants, twist trees, and clog forests with mistletoe.</p>
					<p>Wood woses are cold and uncaring creatures. They capture trespassers for sacrifices to their high queen; particularly dangerous prisoners are kept sedated. Nightshades are not greedy; gold and gems mean little to them. Magic potions and poisons, however, are greatly prized.</p>
					<p>Nightshades are only active during the growing season. During fall, they become sluggish, finally crawling into dark lairs where they hibernate all winter, reawakening in the spring.</p>
					<p>The nightshades' high queen is Ainecotte, the oldest and most intelligent of them all. She has the powers of a 7th-level druid and rules through terror and blackmail.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Nightshades eat the blood and bones of living creatures. Their numbers rarely increase naturally; usually they are created by druids or priests dabbling in necromancy and the dark arts of venoms and unnatural growth.</p>
					<p>Nightshades' only enemies are treants, druids, and rangers, who root them out like weeds. No natural predator will eat a nightshade after the first bite (except hook horrors). Nightwood shades are on good terms with korred, needlemen, and evil myconids. They trade poisons to the quicklings in exchange for weapons.</p>

					<p>Ogres are big, ugly, greedy humanoids that live by ambushes, raids, and theft. Ill-tempered and nasty, these monsters are often found serving as mercenaries in the ranks of orc tribes, evil clerics, or gnolls. They mingle freely with giants and trolls.</p>
					<p>Adult ogres stand 9 to 10 feet tall and weigh 300 to 350 pounds. Their skin colors range from a dead yellow to a dull black-brown, and (rarely) a sickly violet. Their warty bumps are often of a different color - or at least darker than their hides. Their eyes are purple with white pupils. Teeth and talons are orange or black. Ogres have long, greasy hair of blackish-blue to dull dark green. Their odor is repellent, reminiscent of curdled milk. Dressing in poorly cured furs and animal hides, they care for their weapons and armor only reasonably well. It is common for ogres to speak orc, troll, stone giant, and gnoll, as well as their own guttural language. A typical ogre's life span is 90 years.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>In small numbers, ogres fight as unorganized individuals, but groups of 11 or more will have a leader, and groups of 16 or more usually include two leaders and a chieftain. Ogres wielding weapons get a Strength bonus of +2 to hit; leaders have +3, chieftains have +4. Females fight as males but score only <b>2-8 points of damage </b>and have a maximum of only 6 hit points per die. Young ogres fight as goblins.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Ogre tribes are found anywhere, from deep caverns to mountaintops. Tribes have 16-20 males, 2-12 females, and 2-8 young. Shamans, if present, will be of 3rd level, and have access to the spheres of combat, divination, healing, protection, and sun (darkness only). Ogres live by raiding and scavenging and they will eat anything. Their fondness for elf, dwarf, and halfling flesh means that there is only a 10% chance that these will be found as slaves or prisoners. There is a 30% chance that an ogre lair will include 2-8 slaves. Captured prisoners are always kept as slaves (25%) or food (75%). Extremely avaricious, ogres squabble over treasure and cannot be trusted, even by their own kind.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Ogres consistently plague mankind, lusting for gold, gems, and jewelry as well as human flesh. They are evil-natured creatures that join with other monsters to prey on the weak and favor overwhelming odds to a fair fight. Ogres make no crafts nor labor.</p>
					<p><b>Ogre Leader</b></p>
					<p>When more than 11 ogres are encountered, a leader will be present. He is a 7 Hit Dice monster with 30-33 hit points and Armor Class 3. He inflicts 5-15 (2d6+3) points of damage per attack, +6 with weapon.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Ogre Chieftain</b></p>
					<p>If 16 or more ogres are encountered, they will be led by two patrol leaders and a chieftain. The chieftain is a 7 Hit Dice monster with 34-37 hit points and Armor Class 4. He inflicts 8-18 (2d6+6) points of damage per attack, +6 with weapon. Chieftains are usually the biggest and smartest ogres in their tribes.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Ogre Mage</b></p>
					<p>The oriental ogre has light blue, light green, or pale brown skin with ivory horns. The hair is usually a different color (blue with green, green with blue) and is darker in shade; the main exception to this coloration is found in ogre magi with pale brown skin and yellow hair. They have black nails and dark eyes with white pupils. The teeth and tusks are very white. Ogre magi are taller and more intelligent than their cousins and they dress in oriental clothing and armor.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Ogre magi can perform the following feats of magic: <i>fly </i>(for 12 turns), <i>become invisible </i>, <i>cause darkness </i>in a 10-foot radius, <i>polymorph </i>to a human or similar bipedal creature (4 feet to 12 feet tall), and <i>regenerate </i>one hit point per round (lost members must be reattached to regenerate). <b><u>Once per day they can do the following: </u></b><b><i><u>charm person </u></i></b><b><u>, </u></b><b><i><u>sleep </u></i></b><b><u>, </u></b><b><i><u>assume gaseous form </u></i></b><b><u>, and create a </u></b><b><i><u>cone of cold </u></i></b><b><u>60 feet long with a terminal diameter of 20 feet, which inflicts 8-64 (8d8) points of damage (save vs. spell for half damage) </u></b>. Oriental ogres attack with magic first and resort to physical attacks only if necessary. They are +1 on morale.</p>
					<p>In battle, ogre magi prefer the naganata (75%) or scimitar and whip (25%). Those found in oriental settings might (25%) possess ki power or have mastered a martial arts form. As ogre magi are intelligent, they will not fight if faced with overwhelming odds, but will flee to gather their forces or hide.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>These monsters live in fortified dwellings or caves and foray to capture slaves, treasure, and food. Ogre magi priests of up to 7th level have been reported. Tribes are small, with 2-5 females and 1-3 children that will not fight, but rather seek to escape in gaseous form. These monsters are extremely protective of their young and will battle with savage abandon to save one's life. If a young ogre mage is captured, these creatures will pay high ransom for its return, but they will seek revenge and will never forget the insult of the kidnaping.</p>
					<p>If encountered in their lair, ogre magi will be led by a chief of great strength (+2 on each Hit Die, attacking and saving as a 9 Hit Dice monster). Treasure is divided by this chief and his trove is always the richest. The tribe will have their own clan symbol typical to the oriental lands, and this symbol will be stitched on its war banners and flags as well as on armor and headdresses. The chief will often have the tribe's symbol tattooed on his forehead or back.</p>
					<p>Ogre magi speak the common tongue, their own special language, and the speech of normal ogres.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Ogre magi magical armor is too large to fit a man. This monster's lair is usually a powerful structure that can be expanded into a mighty fortress if it can be rid of its original owners.</p>
					<p><b>Merrow (Aquatic Ogre)</b></p>
					<p>Faster and fiercer than their land kin, the freshwater merrow are greenish and scaled with webbed hands and feet. Their necks are long and thick, their shoulders are sloping, and they have huge mouths and undershot jaws. Merrow have black teeth and nails and deep green eyes with white centers, and their hair resembles slimy seaweed. About 10% grow ivory horns, especially the more powerful males.</p>
					<p>Aquatic ogres are very fond of tattoos, and females may have their entire bodies inked with scenes of death and destruction as a sign of status. Merrow speak their own dialect and the language of other ogres.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Using their green coloration, aquatic ogres can hide, becoming effectively invisible 10-80% of the time, depending on terrain. They attack from cover, so others are -5 on their surprise roll. Merrow typically attack with a large piercing spear (inflicting <b>2-12 points of damage </b>) in a swimming charge at +1 to hit, followed by melee with talons and teeth.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>A typical merrow tribe consists of:</p>
					<list>
						<li>1 chief, AC3, 6+6 Hit Dice, +2 on damage</li>
						<li>2 patrol leaders, AC3, 5+5 Hit Dice, +1 on damage</li>
						<li>2-24 standard merrow</li>
						<li>2-24 females, AC5, 3+3 Hit Dice, 1-2/1-2/ <b>1-6 damage</b></li>
						<li>1-12 young, AC6, 2+2 Hit Dice, 1-2/1-2/ <b>1-4 damage</b></li>
						<li>1 shaman of 3rd level ability</li>
					</list>
					<p>Merrow dwell in caves in shallow, fresh water (50-250 feet deep), often with scrags (see Troll). They can live out of water for about two hours, so they often forage on land. Merrow usually control an area with a radius of 10-15 miles, hunting and foraging throughout this territory. In times of scarcity, or when the lure of treasure becomes too great, a war party will attack the coastal villages of man. Merrow prefer gold and jewels and often overlook dull magical items in search of glittering prizes. The goals of a merrow chieftain rule the tribe, and these power-hungry monsters seek to completely control their 'kingdoms', often leading to attacks on intruding ships.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Merrow are ignorant and superstitious and have no skills but plundering and murder. Areas of the freshwater lakes and seas where they have influence are avoided by sailors and fishermen. These monsters are carnivores, preying on all who enter their regions, often emptying the seas of life with their voracious appetites.</p>

					<p>Weasels are abundant throughout the world's temperate forests and in many subterranean settings. There are numerous species, but they are all similar in appearance and habits.</p>
					<p>The weasel is a lithe animal with a slender body and a long neck. The animal's head is small and triangular with a pointed snout and a mouth full of needle-sharp teeth. The various breeds of weasel range from five to 16 inches in length. Nearly all varieties are brown with white undersides, although the furs of those in colder climates turn white in winter.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>As a rule, common weasels do not attack unless they are cornered or surprised. When they do strike, however, their great speed and darting movements can make them somewhat dangerous. In most cases, however, they bite once and then flee before their adversary recovers.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Weasels are solitary creatures that stalk rodents and similar small animals for food. When two animals are encountered, they are often a mated pair.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>When hunting, the weasel usually attacks animals that are larger than itself. A common target in settled regions are domesticated poultry and similar fowl. Despite this, the common weasel does a great service for farmers by feeding on small animall that might otherwise damage or destroy their crops.</p>
					<p>Weasel pelts are highly prized and can fetch prices as high as 100 gold pieces if they are in good condition. It is for this reason that in many regions weasels have been hunted to the brink of extinction, despite their roles as rodent killers and their importance in the food chain of the forest. The most valuable pelts are those of the weasels that inhabit colder regions, as they have a very pleasing texture and are bright white in color.</p>
					<p>Female weasels make their nests out of straw, leaves, and moss in hollow, trees or crevices in the ground. Here they give birth to a litter that generally contains four or five young.</p>
					<p>Weasels that are taken when they are young can be trained to serve as hunting animals or tamed and kept as companions. Generally, however, they are too temperamental to make satisfactory pets.</p>
					<p><b>Giant Weasel</b></p>
					<p>Giant weasels are giant-sized versions of this species that, although similar in many respects to normal weasels, are much more vicious and aggressive. Perhaps the most obvious difference is their tendency to live and hunt in packs. They attack men as often as any other prey and are relentless adversaries.</p>
					<p>When a giant weasel bites, it locks its jaws onto its victim and refuses to let go. Instead, the weasel begins to suck the blood from its prey. Agents in the animal's saliva not only prevent the victim's blood from clotting, but actually promote the bleeding of the wound. The resulting blood loss is so rapid that it causes <b>2d6 points of damage </b>per round. After the initial hit is scored, further rolls to inflict damage are not required.</p>
					<p>When the lair of a pack of giant weasels is found, it often contains a minimum of four animals. There are young equal to the number of adults in the lair; the young are from 10% to 80% grown. They attack just as the adults would, inflicting damage appropriate to their degree of growth. If taken before they are half-grown, there is a 25% chance that giant weasels can be trained to serve as hunting or guard animals.</p>
					<p>The pelts of giant weasels are valuable, as are those of their smaller cousins, and an intact one can fetch from 1,000 to 6,000 gold pieces on the open market. As a general rule, the most valuable pelts are those of the northern species, which are wholly white in color, or those of the rare black weasels.</p>

					<p>Whales are the largest sea mammals. They are highly intelligent creatures that occupy a number of ecological niches. The common whales include plankton eaters like blue or hump-backed whales and carnivores like sperm whales.</p>
					<p>Common whales range in size from a 10-foot-long calf to 110-foot-long blue whales. The skin is normally blue-gray. Whales share a common language that is difficult for land creatures to learn since it uses tones below human hearing.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>All common whales can attack with their tails. These can deliver a crushing blow that inflicts damage equal to half the whale's Hit Dice.</p>
					<p>Plankton-feeding whales can attack with either of their flukes (fins). Whales of 12-17 HD cause <b>1d8 points of damage </b>, those of 18-24 HD inflict 3d8 points, and those of 24-36 HD cause 5d8 points.</p>
					<p>Carnivorous whales can bite. Whales of 12-17 HD inflict <b>5d4 points of damage </b>, those of 18-24 HD cause 1d4x10 points, and those of 24-36 HD inflict 3d4x5 points.</p>
					<p>Whales are vulnerable to surface ships only when the whales are on the surface.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Whales live in tribal gatherings called pods. They maintain strong personal and family ties. Their culture is based on complex songs that can be heard for miles underwater. Whales are curious about humanoids but if attacked they can become deadly foes. Whales rarely initiate combat. Whales are curious about other intelligent beings. They welcome communication with other beings. They do not lie, but they may not reveal everything they know.</p>
					<p>Most whales feed on a variety of plankton, shrimp, and small fish that they suck up as they swim along. Sperm whales feed on larger fish, octopi, and especially giant squids.</p>
					<p>Whale cows normally give birth to a single calf. Twins occur in 5% of births. The calf remains with the cow for the next five to ten years, depending on the species. After five years, the cow may give birth again. The calves are protected and taught by all members of the pod.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Although they are neutral in alignment toward humanoids, their alignment toward sea life is generally lawful good. With their great size, power, and diversity, they are the masters of the sea. They preserve order through their conflicts with evilly inclined sea monsters.</p>
					<p>Unfortunately, their relations with seafarers are less certain. Because of the value placed on parts of the whale's body, the creatures are hunted to excess by greedy whalers. Despite the hostility of the humanoids, whales remain curious and basically friendly toward non-whaling seafarers.</p>
					<p>The carcass of a common whale is worth 100 gp per Hit Die, both for its meat and blubber. Whales possess a stinking, yellow mass called ambergris that is valuable for making perfumes; they vomit this up when ill. The ambergris is worth 1d20 x 1,000 gp.</p>
					<p><b>Giant Whale</b></p>
					<p>Giant whales are immense versions of sperm whales, 100' to 400' long. In the cetacean culture, they serve functions similar to knights or barons by protecting common whales against evil sea monsters and whalers. Giant whales are attended by 2d4 common whales.</p>
					<p>Giant whales attack by biting or crushing. Whales of 18-25 HD inflict 1d4x10 points of damage, those of 26-35 HD cause 2d4x10 points, and those of 36-54 HD inflict 3d4x10 points. The tail can deliver a crushing blow that inflicts damage equal to half the whale's Hit Dice. Giant whales can ram the sides of surface ships, delivering a crushing blow that, if successful, sinks the ship. They can also leap halfway out of the water and fall onto a target vessel (50% chance of success). If successful, the ship is immediately driven under the surface. If a giant whale is facing an opponent under 20 feet long, it can swallow the target intact on an attack roll that is 4 or more greater than it needs to hit.</p>
					<p>Their stomachs contain large air chambers in which a victim might survive until he escapes or is digested. <b><u>The stomach acid is diluted by seawater; characters or objects trapped in the stomach gain a +1 bonus to saving throws vs. this acid </u></b>. A swallowed character suffers 2 points of damage per round (1 if the saving throw is successful each round) from the acid. The stomach might contain undigested possessions of previous meals. Each type of treasure has a 1% chance per Hit Die (of the whale) of being present in the giant whale's gullet. There may be 1,000-3,000 coins of each type, 1d20 gems, or 1d4 magical items.</p>
					<p>The carcass of a giant whale is worth 100 gp per Hit Die. The ambergris is worth 2d20 x 1,000 gp.</p>
					<p><b>Leviathan</b></p>
					<p>The leviathan is an almost unimaginably immense whale, 500 to 1,000 feet long. It is the lord of all whales and the intermediary between cetaceans and the gods. Under normal conditions, only one leviathan dwells in each ocean. The leviathan is not always active. It may hibernate for years on the ocean floor. During these long sleeps, the leviathan is attended and protected by its entourage of other whales. The leviathan awakens if summoned by the needs of other whales or in answer to a divine request. Leviathans are awesome foes with a variety of attacks. Their bite damage is determined by their Hit Dice. Leviathans of 24-35 HD inflict 3d4x5 points of damage, those of 36-47 HD cause 3d4x10 points, and those of 48-72 HD inflict 3d4x15 points. The tail can deliver a crushing blow that causes damage equal to half the whale's Hit Dice. On an attack roll that is 4 or more greater than it needs to hit, a leviathan is capable of swallowing a target up to 80 feet long. When attacking a mass of surface vessels, the leviathan creates a powerful wave by swimming deep, rushing to the surface, and leaping halfway out of the water. <b><u>The resulting wave causes every ship within 500 feet to roll a saving throw vs. crushing blow and every ship within 500 to 2,000 feet to roll a saving throw vs </u></b>. normal blow. Ships that fail a saving throw immediately sink.</p>
					<p>Once each century, leviathans gather in arctic waters to confer and to mate. This gathering lasts six months. Each leviathan is attended by 2d10 giant whales and 10d10 whales of other species.</p>
					<p>The stomach of a leviathan contains air pockets that are capable of sustaining a victim until he escapes or is digested. The stomach may also contain undigested possessions of previous meals or even sea vessels. Each type of treasure has a 1% chance per Hit Die (of the whale) of being present in the giant whale's gullet. There may be 2,000-6,000 coins of each type, 5d20 gems, or 1d8 magical items.</p>
					<p>The carcass of a leviathan is worth 100 gp per Hit Die. The ambergris is worth 4d20 x 1,000 gp. However, the killing of a leviathan will result in every whale within that ocean converging on the killer to avenge their lord's death.</p>
					<p><b>Killer Whale (Orca)</b></p>
					<p>The killer whale is one of the largest predatory sea mammals. It is a deadly killer able to hold its own against all but the most powerful sea monsters. A killer whale is likely to attack humanoids; it is capable of swallowing a man whole, should the need arise.</p>
					<p>Killer whales measure 15 to 30 feet long. Their black bodies are marked by a brilliant white belly and markings that vary from individual to individual.</p>
					<p>Killer whales are not inherently hostile and do not attack unless hungry or provoked. There is a 20% chance that encountered killer whales are hungry. If they are communicated with rather than attacked, killer whales may prefer to talk rather than feed.</p>
					<p>The killer whale's diet consists of both fish and warm-blooded animals. It is a crafty hunter that can recognize the shadows and sounds made by animals atop ice floes. It will break through the ice to visually confirm the presence of prey. Smaller ice floes are rammed and shattered to force the prey into the water. <b><u>When the killer whale smashes into the ice, every being on the ice must roll a saving throw vs. paralyzation </u></b>. Failure means the being has slipped into the water and can be attacked the following round.</p>
					<p>When a killer whale makes a successful hit, its prey is held in its jaws where it can automatically bite each round. Victims risk drowning in two to four rounds and the loss of 1 point of Strength and Dexterity per round, due to the numbing effect of the icy water. When either Strength or Dexterity reaches 0, the victim dies.</p>
					<p>The killer whale's main weapon is its terrible bite. Killer whales of 9-10 HD inflict <b>4d6 points of damage </b>, while those of 11-12 HD cause 6d4 points.</p>
					<p>When hunting larger creatures, the pod acts together to bring down prey of up to 100 feet in length.</p>
					<p>Most pods consist only of adults, but 25% of encountered pods also have 1d8 calves (2-5 HD, swim 15, bite for 2d4). Adults defend their calves to the death. They also assist each other.</p>
					<p>Although killer whales prey on other whales, they also act as their protectors by battling other sea monsters that might decimate the entire cetacean family. Killer whales may enter into alliances with aquatic elves.</p>
					<p>The carcass of a killer whale is worth 100 gp per Hit Die. The ambergris is worth 1d10 x 500 gp.</p>
					<p><b>Narwhal</b></p>
					<p>The narwhal is common to cold, subarctic waters. It is called the 'unicorn of the sea' because of the 6- to 12-foot-long spiral horn that the narwhal uses to dig into the sea floor for shellfish. If a narwhal is provoked, the horn can also be used like a lance to attack. When a narwhal attacks with its horn, its Hit Dice determine the damage caused. A narwhal of 4+4 HD inflicts <b>2d12 points of damage </b>, one of 5+5 HD causes 6d4 points, and one of 6+6 HD inflicts 7d4 points. Only a male can develop this horn. A female attacks by ramming headfirst into its target, inflicting <b>2d4 points of damage </b>.</p>
					<p>Narwhals are basically peaceful creatures. They may serve as companions or guards for dolphins. They may also be trained and used by aquatic elves.</p>
					<p>The carcass of a narwhal is worth 100 gp per Hit Die. The ivory is worth 1d4x10 gp. The ambergris is worth 1d10 x 200 gp.</p>

					<p>Whales are the largest sea mammals. They are highly intelligent creatures that occupy a number of ecological niches. The common whales include plankton eaters like blue or hump-backed whales and carnivores like sperm whales.</p>
					<p>Common whales range in size from a 10-foot-long calf to 110-foot-long blue whales. The skin is normally blue-gray. Whales share a common language that is difficult for land creatures to learn since it uses tones below human hearing.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>All common whales can attack with their tails. These can deliver a crushing blow that inflicts damage equal to half the whale's Hit Dice.</p>
					<p>Plankton-feeding whales can attack with either of their flukes (fins). Whales of 12-17 HD cause <b>1d8 points of damage </b>, those of 18-24 HD inflict 3d8 points, and those of 24-36 HD cause 5d8 points.</p>
					<p>Carnivorous whales can bite. Whales of 12-17 HD inflict <b>5d4 points of damage </b>, those of 18-24 HD cause 1d4x10 points, and those of 24-36 HD inflict 3d4x5 points.</p>
					<p>Whales are vulnerable to surface ships only when the whales are on the surface.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Whales live in tribal gatherings called pods. They maintain strong personal and family ties. Their culture is based on complex songs that can be heard for miles underwater. Whales are curious about humanoids but if attacked they can become deadly foes. Whales rarely initiate combat. Whales are curious about other intelligent beings. They welcome communication with other beings. They do not lie, but they may not reveal everything they know.</p>
					<p>Most whales feed on a variety of plankton, shrimp, and small fish that they suck up as they swim along. Sperm whales feed on larger fish, octopi, and especially giant squids.</p>
					<p>Whale cows normally give birth to a single calf. Twins occur in 5% of births. The calf remains with the cow for the next five to ten years, depending on the species. After five years, the cow may give birth again. The calves are protected and taught by all members of the pod.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Although they are neutral in alignment toward humanoids, their alignment toward sea life is generally lawful good. With their great size, power, and diversity, they are the masters of the sea. They preserve order through their conflicts with evilly inclined sea monsters.</p>
					<p>Unfortunately, their relations with seafarers are less certain. Because of the value placed on parts of the whale's body, the creatures are hunted to excess by greedy whalers. Despite the hostility of the humanoids, whales remain curious and basically friendly toward non-whaling seafarers.</p>
					<p>The carcass of a common whale is worth 100 gp per Hit Die, both for its meat and blubber. Whales possess a stinking, yellow mass called ambergris that is valuable for making perfumes; they vomit this up when ill. The ambergris is worth 1d20 x 1,000 gp.</p>
					<p><b>Giant Whale</b></p>
					<p>Giant whales are immense versions of sperm whales, 100' to 400' long. In the cetacean culture, they serve functions similar to knights or barons by protecting common whales against evil sea monsters and whalers. Giant whales are attended by 2d4 common whales.</p>
					<p>Giant whales attack by biting or crushing. Whales of 18-25 HD inflict 1d4x10 points of damage, those of 26-35 HD cause 2d4x10 points, and those of 36-54 HD inflict 3d4x10 points. The tail can deliver a crushing blow that inflicts damage equal to half the whale's Hit Dice. Giant whales can ram the sides of surface ships, delivering a crushing blow that, if successful, sinks the ship. They can also leap halfway out of the water and fall onto a target vessel (50% chance of success). If successful, the ship is immediately driven under the surface. If a giant whale is facing an opponent under 20 feet long, it can swallow the target intact on an attack roll that is 4 or more greater than it needs to hit.</p>
					<p>Their stomachs contain large air chambers in which a victim might survive until he escapes or is digested. <b><u>The stomach acid is diluted by seawater; characters or objects trapped in the stomach gain a +1 bonus to saving throws vs. this acid </u></b>. A swallowed character suffers 2 points of damage per round (1 if the saving throw is successful each round) from the acid. The stomach might contain undigested possessions of previous meals. Each type of treasure has a 1% chance per Hit Die (of the whale) of being present in the giant whale's gullet. There may be 1,000-3,000 coins of each type, 1d20 gems, or 1d4 magical items.</p>
					<p>The carcass of a giant whale is worth 100 gp per Hit Die. The ambergris is worth 2d20 x 1,000 gp.</p>
					<p><b>Leviathan</b></p>
					<p>The leviathan is an almost unimaginably immense whale, 500 to 1,000 feet long. It is the lord of all whales and the intermediary between cetaceans and the gods. Under normal conditions, only one leviathan dwells in each ocean. The leviathan is not always active. It may hibernate for years on the ocean floor. During these long sleeps, the leviathan is attended and protected by its entourage of other whales. The leviathan awakens if summoned by the needs of other whales or in answer to a divine request. Leviathans are awesome foes with a variety of attacks. Their bite damage is determined by their Hit Dice. Leviathans of 24-35 HD inflict 3d4x5 points of damage, those of 36-47 HD cause 3d4x10 points, and those of 48-72 HD inflict 3d4x15 points. The tail can deliver a crushing blow that causes damage equal to half the whale's Hit Dice. On an attack roll that is 4 or more greater than it needs to hit, a leviathan is capable of swallowing a target up to 80 feet long. When attacking a mass of surface vessels, the leviathan creates a powerful wave by swimming deep, rushing to the surface, and leaping halfway out of the water. <b><u>The resulting wave causes every ship within 500 feet to roll a saving throw vs. crushing blow and every ship within 500 to 2,000 feet to roll a saving throw vs </u></b>. normal blow. Ships that fail a saving throw immediately sink.</p>

					<p>The carcass of a leviathan is worth 100 gp per Hit Die. The ambergris is worth 4d20 x 1,000 gp. However, the killing of a leviathan will result in every whale within that ocean converging on the killer to avenge their lord's death.</p>

					<p>Whales are the largest sea mammals. They are highly intelligent creatures that occupy a number of ecological niches. The common whales include plankton eaters like blue or hump-backed whales and carnivores like sperm whales.</p>
					<p>Common whales range in size from a 10-foot-long calf to 110-foot-long blue whales. The skin is normally blue-gray. Whales share a common language that is difficult for land creatures to learn since it uses tones below human hearing.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>All common whales can attack with their tails. These can deliver a crushing blow that inflicts damage equal to half the whale's Hit Dice.</p>
					<p>Plankton-feeding whales can attack with either of their flukes (fins). Whales of 12-17 HD cause <b>1d8 points of damage </b>, those of 18-24 HD inflict 3d8 points, and those of 24-36 HD cause 5d8 points.</p>
					<p>Carnivorous whales can bite. Whales of 12-17 HD inflict <b>5d4 points of damage </b>, those of 18-24 HD cause 1d4x10 points, and those of 24-36 HD inflict 3d4x5 points.</p>
					<p>Whales are vulnerable to surface ships only when the whales are on the surface.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Whales live in tribal gatherings called pods. They maintain strong personal and family ties. Their culture is based on complex songs that can be heard for miles underwater. Whales are curious about humanoids but if attacked they can become deadly foes. Whales rarely initiate combat. Whales are curious about other intelligent beings. They welcome communication with other beings. They do not lie, but they may not reveal everything they know.</p>
					<p>Most whales feed on a variety of plankton, shrimp, and small fish that they suck up as they swim along. Sperm whales feed on larger fish, octopi, and especially giant squids.</p>
					<p>Whale cows normally give birth to a single calf. Twins occur in 5% of births. The calf remains with the cow for the next five to ten years, depending on the species. After five years, the cow may give birth again. The calves are protected and taught by all members of the pod.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Although they are neutral in alignment toward humanoids, their alignment toward sea life is generally lawful good. With their great size, power, and diversity, they are the masters of the sea. They preserve order through their conflicts with evilly inclined sea monsters.</p>
					<p>Unfortunately, their relations with seafarers are less certain. Because of the value placed on parts of the whale's body, the creatures are hunted to excess by greedy whalers. Despite the hostility of the humanoids, whales remain curious and basically friendly toward non-whaling seafarers.</p>
					<p>The carcass of a common whale is worth 100 gp per Hit Die, both for its meat and blubber. Whales possess a stinking, yellow mass called ambergris that is valuable for making perfumes; they vomit this up when ill. The ambergris is worth 1d20 x 1,000 gp.</p>
					<p><b>Giant Whale</b></p>
					<p>Giant whales are immense versions of sperm whales, 100' to 400' long. In the cetacean culture, they serve functions similar to knights or barons by protecting common whales against evil sea monsters and whalers. Giant whales are attended by 2d4 common whales.</p>
					<p>Giant whales attack by biting or crushing. Whales of 18-25 HD inflict 1d4x10 points of damage, those of 26-35 HD cause 2d4x10 points, and those of 36-54 HD inflict 3d4x10 points. The tail can deliver a crushing blow that inflicts damage equal to half the whale's Hit Dice. Giant whales can ram the sides of surface ships, delivering a crushing blow that, if successful, sinks the ship. They can also leap halfway out of the water and fall onto a target vessel (50% chance of success). If successful, the ship is immediately driven under the surface. If a giant whale is facing an opponent under 20 feet long, it can swallow the target intact on an attack roll that is 4 or more greater than it needs to hit.</p>
					<p>Their stomachs contain large air chambers in which a victim might survive until he escapes or is digested. <b><u>The stomach acid is diluted by seawater; characters or objects trapped in the stomach gain a +1 bonus to saving throws vs. this acid </u></b>. A swallowed character suffers 2 points of damage per round (1 if the saving throw is successful each round) from the acid. The stomach might contain undigested possessions of previous meals. Each type of treasure has a 1% chance per Hit Die (of the whale) of being present in the giant whale's gullet. There may be 1,000-3,000 coins of each type, 1d20 gems, or 1d4 magical items.</p>
					<p>The carcass of a giant whale is worth 100 gp per Hit Die. The ambergris is worth 2d20 x 1,000 gp.</p>
					<p><b>Leviathan</b></p>
					<p>The leviathan is an almost unimaginably immense whale, 500 to 1,000 feet long. It is the lord of all whales and the intermediary between cetaceans and the gods. Under normal conditions, only one leviathan dwells in each ocean. The leviathan is not always active. It may hibernate for years on the ocean floor. During these long sleeps, the leviathan is attended and protected by its entourage of other whales. The leviathan awakens if summoned by the needs of other whales or in answer to a divine request. Leviathans are awesome foes with a variety of attacks. Their bite damage is determined by their Hit Dice. Leviathans of 24-35 HD inflict 3d4x5 points of damage, those of 36-47 HD cause 3d4x10 points, and those of 48-72 HD inflict 3d4x15 points. The tail can deliver a crushing blow that causes damage equal to half the whale's Hit Dice. On an attack roll that is 4 or more greater than it needs to hit, a leviathan is capable of swallowing a target up to 80 feet long. When attacking a mass of surface vessels, the leviathan creates a powerful wave by swimming deep, rushing to the surface, and leaping halfway out of the water. <b><u>The resulting wave causes every ship within 500 feet to roll a saving throw vs. crushing blow and every ship within 500 to 2,000 feet to roll a saving throw vs </u></b>. normal blow. Ships that fail a saving throw immediately sink.</p>
					<p>Once each century, leviathans gather in arctic waters to confer and to mate. This gathering lasts six months. Each leviathan is attended by 2d10 giant whales and 10d10 whales of other species.</p>
					<p>The stomach of a leviathan contains air pockets that are capable of sustaining a victim until he escapes or is digested. The stomach may also contain undigested possessions of previous meals or even sea vessels. Each type of treasure has a 1% chance per Hit Die (of the whale) of being present in the giant whale's gullet. There may be 2,000-6,000 coins of each type, 5d20 gems, or 1d8 magical items.</p>
					<p>The carcass of a leviathan is worth 100 gp per Hit Die. The ambergris is worth 4d20 x 1,000 gp. However, the killing of a leviathan will result in every whale within that ocean converging on the killer to avenge their lord's death.</p>
					<p><b>Killer Whale (Orca)</b></p>
					<p>The killer whale is one of the largest predatory sea mammals. It is a deadly killer able to hold its own against all but the most powerful sea monsters. A killer whale is likely to attack humanoids; it is capable of swallowing a man whole, should the need arise.</p>
					<p>Killer whales measure 15 to 30 feet long. Their black bodies are marked by a brilliant white belly and markings that vary from individual to individual.</p>
					<p>Killer whales are not inherently hostile and do not attack unless hungry or provoked. There is a 20% chance that encountered killer whales are hungry. If they are communicated with rather than attacked, killer whales may prefer to talk rather than feed.</p>
					<p>The killer whale's diet consists of both fish and warm-blooded animals. It is a crafty hunter that can recognize the shadows and sounds made by animals atop ice floes. It will break through the ice to visually confirm the presence of prey. Smaller ice floes are rammed and shattered to force the prey into the water. <b><u>When the killer whale smashes into the ice, every being on the ice must roll a saving throw vs. paralyzation </u></b>. Failure means the being has slipped into the water and can be attacked the following round.</p>
					<p>When a killer whale makes a successful hit, its prey is held in its jaws where it can automatically bite each round. Victims risk drowning in two to four rounds and the loss of 1 point of Strength and Dexterity per round, due to the numbing effect of the icy water. When either Strength or Dexterity reaches 0, the victim dies.</p>
					<p>The killer whale's main weapon is its terrible bite. Killer whales of 9-10 HD inflict <b>4d6 points of damage </b>, while those of 11-12 HD cause 6d4 points.</p>
					<p>When hunting larger creatures, the pod acts together to bring down prey of up to 100 feet in length.</p>
					<p>Most pods consist only of adults, but 25% of encountered pods also have 1d8 calves (2-5 HD, swim 15, bite for 2d4). Adults defend their calves to the death. They also assist each other.</p>
					<p>Although killer whales prey on other whales, they also act as their protectors by battling other sea monsters that might decimate the entire cetacean family. Killer whales may enter into alliances with aquatic elves.</p>
					<p>The carcass of a killer whale is worth 100 gp per Hit Die. The ambergris is worth 1d10 x 500 gp.</p>
					<p><b>Narwhal</b></p>
					<p>The narwhal is common to cold, subarctic waters. It is called the 'unicorn of the sea' because of the 6- to 12-foot-long spiral horn that the narwhal uses to dig into the sea floor for shellfish. If a narwhal is provoked, the horn can also be used like a lance to attack. When a narwhal attacks with its horn, its Hit Dice determine the damage caused. A narwhal of 4+4 HD inflicts <b>2d12 points of damage </b>, one of 5+5 HD causes 6d4 points, and one of 6+6 HD inflicts 7d4 points. Only a male can develop this horn. A female attacks by ramming headfirst into its target, inflicting <b>2d4 points of damage </b>.</p>
					<p>Narwhals are basically peaceful creatures. They may serve as companions or guards for dolphins. They may also be trained and used by aquatic elves.</p>
					<p>The carcass of a narwhal is worth 100 gp per Hit Die. The ivory is worth 1d4x10 gp. The ambergris is worth 1d10 x 200 gp.</p>

					<p>Known also as the carcajou, quickhatch, and glutton, this fierce animal has been the scourge of many arctic cultures since the dawn of time.</p>
					<p>The wolverine is closely related to the weasel, but in habit and physiology it has much more in common with the badger. The body of a wolverine is heavyset with short, thick legs. Its claws are long and curved, making it a very dangerous hunter. The wolverine's head is blunt and rounded with wide-set eyes and a short sharp snout. Its body has a coat of brown fur with a light stripe running down each side. Its skeleton carries the head and tail low with an arch in the back.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>When engaging in battle, the wolverine becomes a most fearsome adversary. Its great speed makes it difficult to strike (thus its decent Armor Class) and gives it a +4 bonus on its attack roll.</p>
					<p>The wolverine normally attacks with a combination of its wicked claws and needle-like teeth. Its great speed enables it to strike once with each of its front claws and then follow that up with a ripping bite.</p>
					<p>Enemies who are behind the wolverine are subject to attack by its musk gland. Like a skunk, this animal can release an oil that is disgusting to most other life forms. This spray takes the form of a cloud 10 feet wide by 10 feet high and 30 feet long. <b><u>A victim of the musk must roll a successful saving throw vs. poison or be blinded for 1d4 hours </u></b>. Even if the saving throw is successful, the victim instinctively draws back from the animal by half of its normal movement rate and loses 25% of his Strength and Dexterity for 1d4 turns due to nausea. Anyone who comes into the slightest contact with the wolverine's musk is tainted by its foul stench and is shunned by all animals until he can be thoroughly cleaned.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Wolverines are loners that range throughout the forests of colder climates. Occasionally they are found in more temperate woodlands as well. Sometimes two wolverines may be encountered together, but they are almost always a mated pair that will go their own ways before long.</p>
					<p>Female wolverines who have mated generally give birth to one to four pups in the late winter or early spring months. These animals are nurtured by the mother and remain with her until they are able to survive on their own.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>For the most part, wolverines are carnivores that take small mammals and rodents as prey. In times when food is short, they feed on carrion if unable to make their own kills. In addition, wolverines are clever, adept at looting the traps set for them by men.</p>
					<p>In many regions where wolverines co-exist with man, they are hunted to the brink of destruction. The reasons for this are two-fold. Primarily, the animals are seen as a threat and as competitors for small game. Secondly, the pelt of a wolverine is exceptionally <b><u>resistant to cold and frost, making it very useful in the manufacture of winter clothing </u></b>.</p>
					<p><b>Giant Wolverines</b></p>
					<p>These fiendish creatures are vicious beasts that, like their more common cousins, take whatever prey they can. Unlike common wolverines, the giants often attack human travelers.</p>
					<p>Creatures subjected to the creature's musk find thar it is even more fearsome than that of the common wolverine. Because of its more vile nature and the greater quantity released, the musk of a giant wolverine is twice as potent as normal wolverine musk. For example, the cloud formed is 20 feet by 20 feet by 60 feet and those in it may be blinded for 1d8 hours. In addition to these effects, however, the oil has several other properties that must be taken into account. The victim must retreat at full speed for one round, and he loses 50% of his Strength and Dexterity for 1d8 turns. <b><u>All cloth items contacted by the spray rot and become useless in a matter of hours (including magical cloth or parchment items that fail their saving throws vs. acid) </u></b>.</p>

					<p>Sea zombies, also known as drowned ones, are the animated corpses of humans who died at sea.</p>
					<p>Sea zombies look like human corpses that have been underwater for some time. Their bloated and discolored flesh drips with foul water. Their eyesockets are empty and their tongue frequently protrudes from between blackened lips. Often, they bear the marks of having been feasted upon by the creatures of the deep. <b><u>Their visage and their stench of decay are so disgusting that anyone seeing a drowned one from 20 feet or less must successfully save vs. poison </u></b>. A failed save indicates that the character is nauseated and horrified, suffering a -1 penalty to his attack rolls and a +1 penalty to his AC for 2d4 rounds. On land, sea zombies move slowly, with a clumsy, shambling gait. In water, however, they can swim with frightening speed.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Like most undead, sea zombies have an abiding hatred for the living and attack them at any opportunity. These attacks often show surprising cunning. For example, they may lure ships onto the rocks and attack the sailors as the victims try to save themselves from the wreck. Sea zombies take advantage of their swimming speed by attacking ships as they lie at anchor. They climb aboard the vessel and try to drive the sailojs overboard where they can attack them more easily.</p>
					<p>Sea zombies often attack with the weapons typical of sailors, such as short swords, daggers, hooks, and clubs. The creatures possess unnatural strength, so these weapons all inflict <b>1d10 points of damage </b>. The putrid water that drips from the sea zombies contains many diseases, so any successful hit has a 10% chance of causing a severe blood disease in the victim. <b><u>The water-logged condition of the beast's flesh means that fire-based attacks cause only half damage </u></b>. Lightning, electrical, and cold-based attacks inflict double damage. Sea zombies are <b><u>immune to </u></b><b><i><u>sleep </u></i></b><b><u>, </u></b><b><i><u>charm </u></i></b><b><u>, </u></b><b><i><u>illusion </u></i></b><b><u>, and other mind altering spells </u></b>.</p>
					<p>Sea zombies retain the powers they had when they were alive. There is a 25% chance that each sea zombie encountered is a spellcaster of level 1-6. They receive their spells directly from the Dark Powers of the demiplane.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Sea zombies congregate in loose packs. Their only motivation for living is hatred for those who are alive. Because they are undead, they have no need to eat, but they sometimes rend and chew the flesh of their prey, although this is probably just to strike terror in others. Underwater, sea zombies are active 24 hours a day and are often found in the sunken wrecks of the ships in which they drowned. They are only active above water during the night. Sea zombies normally stray no farther than 100 yards from the water. If the wind drives a fog inward along the coast, however, the fog allows them to roam inland as far as the substance reaches. When the fog retreats, or when the sun is about to rise, the sea zombies must return to the water. Dwellers on foggy coastlines usually fear the fog for just this reason. In some areas, living sacrifices are often cast into the fogs when they roll inland, in the hopes that sea zombies take the offerings and leave everyone else alone.</p>
					<p>Sea zombies communicate among themselves by a form of telepathy. They have no need of a spoken language, other than for spellcasting. The verbal components for spells are spoken in unintelligible whispers.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Sea zombies consume and produce nothing. They interact among themselves only to make their killing more effective.</p>

					<p>A greater golem is an artificial humanoid body which has been animated by an elemental spirit but remains under the complete control of its creator.</p>
					<p><b>Stone Golem</b></p>
					<p>A stone golem is 91/2 feet tall, and weighs around 2000 pounds. Its body is of roughly chiseled stone, frequently stylized to suit its creator. For example it might be carved to to look like it is wearing armor with a particular symbol on the chest plate. Sometimes designs are worked into the stone of its limbs. The head may be chiseled to resemble a helmet or other head piece. Regardless of these elements, it always has the basic humanoid parts (2 arms, 2 legs, head with 2 eyes, nose, mouth etc.). It is always weaponless and never wears clothing.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Greater golems are mindless in combat, only following the simple tactics of their masters. They are completely emotionless and cannot be swayed in any way from their instructions. They will not pick up and use weapons in combat, even if ordered to, always preferring their fists. Stone golems have a strength of 22, for purposes of breaking or throwing things.</p>
					<p>The stone golem is <b><u>immune to any weapon, except those of +2 or better enchantment </u></b>. A <i>rock to mud </i>spell <i>slows </i>a golem for 2-12 (2d6) rounds. Its reverse, <i>mud to rock </i>, acts to heal the golem, restoring all lost hit points. A <i>flesh to stone </i>spell does not actually change the golem's structure, but does make it vulnerable to any normal attack for the following round. This does not include spells, except those that will cause direct damage. All other spells are ignored. Once every other round, the stone golem can cast a <i>slow </i>spell upon any opponent with 10 feet of it.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Golems are automatons, artificially created and under the direct control of their creator. They have no society and are not associated with any particular habitat. They are frequently used to guard valuable items or places. Unlike the lesser golems, the greater golems are always under the complete control of their master. A greater golem can obey simple instructions involving direct actions with simple conditional phrases. Although this is better than a lesser golem is capable of following, they still make poor servants. Any given task could take several separate commands to direct the golem to its completion.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Golems are not natural creatures, and play no part in the ecology of the world. They neither eat nor sleep, and 'live' until they are destroyed, usually in combat. Certain spells (see above) can be used to heal or repair any damage done to them in combat. This is usually done by their creators to insure long and valuable service.</p>
					<p><b>Iron Golem</b></p>
					<p>An iron golem is twice the height of a normal man, and weighs around 5000 pounds. It can be fashioned in any stylized manner, just like the stone golems, although it almost always is built displaying armor of some sort. Its features are much smoother in contrast to the stone golem. Iron golems are sometimes found with a short sword (relative to their size) in one hand. On extremely rare occasions this sword will be magical.</p>
					<p>The iron golem cannot speak or make any vocal noise, nor does it have any distinguishable odor. It moves with a ponderously smooth gait at half the speed of a normal man. Each step causes the floor to tremble, unless it is on a thick, solid foundation.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>The iron golem conforms to the strategies listed for the stone golem except as described here. It has a strength of 24 for the purposes of lifting, throwing or breaking objects. The iron golem is <b><u>immune to any weapon, except those of +3 or better enchantment </u></b>. Magical electrical attacks will slow it for 3 rounds, and magical fire attacks actually repair 1 hit point of damage for each hit die of damage it would have caused. All other spells are ignored. Iron golems are subject to the damage inflicted by a rust monster. Once every 7 rounds, beginning either the first or second round of combat, the iron golem breathes out a cloud of poisonous gas. It does this automatically, with no regard to the effects it might have. The gas cloud fills a 10 foot cube directly in front of it, which dissipates by the following round, assuming there is somewhere for the gas to go.</p>

					<p>A greater golem is an artificial humanoid body which has been animated by an elemental spirit but remains under the complete control of its creator.</p>
					<p><b>Stone Golem</b></p>
					<p>A stone golem is 91/2 feet tall, and weighs around 2000 pounds. Its body is of roughly chiseled stone, frequently stylized to suit its creator. For example it might be carved to to look like it is wearing armor with a particular symbol on the chest plate. Sometimes designs are worked into the stone of its limbs. The head may be chiseled to resemble a helmet or other head piece. Regardless of these elements, it always has the basic humanoid parts (2 arms, 2 legs, head with 2 eyes, nose, mouth etc.). It is always weaponless and never wears clothing.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Greater golems are mindless in combat, only following the simple tactics of their masters. They are completely emotionless and cannot be swayed in any way from their instructions. They will not pick up and use weapons in combat, even if ordered to, always preferring their fists. Stone golems have a strength of 22, for purposes of breaking or throwing things.</p>
					<p>The stone golem is <b><u>immune to any weapon, except those of +2 or better enchantment </u></b>. A <i>rock to mud </i>spell <i>slows </i>a golem for 2-12 (2d6) rounds. Its reverse, <i>mud to rock </i>, acts to heal the golem, restoring all lost hit points. A <i>flesh to stone </i>spell does not actually change the golem's structure, but does make it vulnerable to any normal attack for the following round. This does not include spells, except those that will cause direct damage. All other spells are ignored. Once every other round, the stone golem can cast a <i>slow </i>spell upon any opponent with 10 feet of it.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Golems are automatons, artificially created and under the direct control of their creator. They have no society and are not associated with any particular habitat. They are frequently used to guard valuable items or places. Unlike the lesser golems, the greater golems are always under the complete control of their master. A greater golem can obey simple instructions involving direct actions with simple conditional phrases. Although this is better than a lesser golem is capable of following, they still make poor servants. Any given task could take several separate commands to direct the golem to its completion.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Golems are not natural creatures, and play no part in the ecology of the world. They neither eat nor sleep, and 'live' until they are destroyed, usually in combat. Certain spells (see above) can be used to heal or repair any damage done to them in combat. This is usually done by their creators to insure long and valuable service.</p>
					<p><b>Iron Golem</b></p>
					<p>An iron golem is twice the height of a normal man, and weighs around 5000 pounds. It can be fashioned in any stylized manner, just like the stone golems, although it almost always is built displaying armor of some sort. Its features are much smoother in contrast to the stone golem. Iron golems are sometimes found with a short sword (relative to their size) in one hand. On extremely rare occasions this sword will be magical.</p>
					<p>The iron golem cannot speak or make any vocal noise, nor does it have any distinguishable odor. It moves with a ponderously smooth gait at half the speed of a normal man. Each step causes the floor to tremble, unless it is on a thick, solid foundation.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>The iron golem conforms to the strategies listed for the stone golem except as described here. It has a strength of 24 for the purposes of lifting, throwing or breaking objects. The iron golem is <b><u>immune to any weapon, except those of +3 or better enchantment </u></b>. Magical electrical attacks will slow it for 3 rounds, and magical fire attacks actually repair 1 hit point of damage for each hit die of damage it would have caused. All other spells are ignored. Iron golems are subject to the damage inflicted by a rust monster. Once every 7 rounds, beginning either the first or second round of combat, the iron golem breathes out a cloud of poisonous gas. It does this automatically, with no regard to the effects it might have. The gas cloud fills a 10 foot cube directly in front of it, which dissipates by the following round, assuming there is somewhere for the gas to go.</p>

					<p>A golem is an artificial humanoid body which is animated by an elemental spirit and under the control of its creator.</p>
					<p><b>Flesh Golem</b></p>
					<p>The flesh golem stands a head and a half taller than most humans and weighs almost 350 pounds. It is made from a ghoulish collection of stolen human body parts, stitched together to form a single composite human body. Its skin is the sickly green or yellow of partially decayed flesh. A flesh golem smells faintly of freshly dug earth and dead flesh. No natural animal, such as a dog, will willingly track a flesh golem.</p>
					<p>It wears whatever clothing its creator desires, usually just a ragged pair of trousers. It has no possessions, and no weapons. The golem can not speak, although it can emit a hoarse roar of sorts. It walks and moves with a stiff jointed gait, as if it is not in complete control over its body parts.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>The lesser golems are mindless in combat. They follow the orders of their master explicitly, and are incapable of any strategy or tactics. They are emotionless in combat, and cannot be easily provoked (unless they have broken control and gone berserk). They will not use weapons for combat, even if ordered to, always preferring to strike with their fists. Flesh golems have a strength of 19 for purposes of lifting, throwing or breaking down doors.</p>
					<p>Flesh golems can only be struck by a magical weapon. Fire and cold based spells merely slow them for 2-12 (2d6) rounds. Any electrical attack restores 1 hit point for each die of damage it would normally have done. All other spells are ignored by the creature.</p>
					<p>The elemental spirit in a lesser golem is not bound strongly, resulting in a 1% cumulative chance per round of combat, calculated independently for each fight, that it will break free of its master. The flesh golem's master has a 10% chance per round of regaining control. To do this he must be within 60 feet of the flesh golem, and the creature must be able to see and hear its master. No special spells are required to regain control, its creator just has to talk to it forcefully and persuasively, to convince it to obey.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Golems are automatons, artificially created and under the direct control of their creator. They have no society and are not associated with any particular habitat. They are frequently used to guard valuable items or places. A lesser golem can obey simple instructions involving a single, direct action. They make poor servants because each detail of a task must be given as a separate command.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Golems are not natural creatures, and play no part in the world's ecology. They neither eat nor sleep, and 'live' until their bodies are destroyed, usually in combat.</p>
					<p><b>Clay Golem</b></p>
					<p>The clay golem is a humanoid body made from clay, and stands about 18 inches taller than a normal man. It weighs around 600 pounds. The features are grossly distorted from the human norm. The chest is overly large, with arms attached by thick knots of muscle at the shoulder. Its arms hang down to its knees, and end in short stubby fingers. It has no neck, and a large head with broad flat features. Its legs are short and bowed, with wide flat feet. A clay golem wears no clothing except for a metal or stiff leather garment around its hips. It smells faintly of clay. The golem can not speak, or make any noise. It walks and moves with a slow and clumsy gait, almost as if it were not in control over its actions.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Clay golems conform to the strategies listed above for the flesh golem except as noted here. A clay golem has a strength of 20 for the purposes of lifting, throwing or smashing objects. They can only be struck by magical blunt weapons such as hammers or maces. A <i>move earth </i>spell will drive the golem back 120 feet and inflict 3-36 (3d12) points of damage upon it. A <i>disintegrate </i>spell merely <i>slows </i>the golem for 1-6 rounds and causes <b>1-12 points of damage </b>. An <i>earthquake </i>spell cast directly at a clay golem will stop it from moving that turn and inflict 5-50 (5d10) points of damage. After it has engaged in at least one round of combat, the clay golem can haste itself for 3 rounds. It can only do this once per day. Damage done by the golem can only be cured by a <i>heal </i>spell from a priest of 17th level or greater.</p>
					<p>The elemental spirit in a lesser golem is not bound strongly, resulting in a 1% cumulative chance per round of combat, calculated independently for each fight, that it will break free of its master. If a clay golem does manage to break control, it becomes a berserker, attacking everything in sight until it is destroyed. Its first action is to <i>haste </i>itself, if it can. Unlike the flesh golem, there is no chance to regain control of a rampaging clay golem.</p>

					<p>A golem is an artificial humanoid body which is animated by an elemental spirit and under the control of its creator.</p>
					<p><b>Flesh Golem</b></p>
					<p>The flesh golem stands a head and a half taller than most humans and weighs almost 350 pounds. It is made from a ghoulish collection of stolen human body parts, stitched together to form a single composite human body. Its skin is the sickly green or yellow of partially decayed flesh. A flesh golem smells faintly of freshly dug earth and dead flesh. No natural animal, such as a dog, will willingly track a flesh golem.</p>
					<p>It wears whatever clothing its creator desires, usually just a ragged pair of trousers. It has no possessions, and no weapons. The golem can not speak, although it can emit a hoarse roar of sorts. It walks and moves with a stiff jointed gait, as if it is not in complete control over its body parts.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>The lesser golems are mindless in combat. They follow the orders of their master explicitly, and are incapable of any strategy or tactics. They are emotionless in combat, and cannot be easily provoked (unless they have broken control and gone berserk). They will not use weapons for combat, even if ordered to, always preferring to strike with their fists. Flesh golems have a strength of 19 for purposes of lifting, throwing or breaking down doors.</p>
					<p>Flesh golems can only be struck by a magical weapon. Fire and cold based spells merely slow them for 2-12 (2d6) rounds. Any electrical attack restores 1 hit point for each die of damage it would normally have done. All other spells are ignored by the creature.</p>
					<p>The elemental spirit in a lesser golem is not bound strongly, resulting in a 1% cumulative chance per round of combat, calculated independently for each fight, that it will break free of its master. The flesh golem's master has a 10% chance per round of regaining control. To do this he must be within 60 feet of the flesh golem, and the creature must be able to see and hear its master. No special spells are required to regain control, its creator just has to talk to it forcefully and persuasively, to convince it to obey.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Golems are automatons, artificially created and under the direct control of their creator. They have no society and are not associated with any particular habitat. They are frequently used to guard valuable items or places. A lesser golem can obey simple instructions involving a single, direct action. They make poor servants because each detail of a task must be given as a separate command.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>Golems are not natural creatures, and play no part in the world's ecology. They neither eat nor sleep, and 'live' until their bodies are destroyed, usually in combat.</p>
					<p><b>Clay Golem</b></p>
					<p>The clay golem is a humanoid body made from clay, and stands about 18 inches taller than a normal man. It weighs around 600 pounds. The features are grossly distorted from the human norm. The chest is overly large, with arms attached by thick knots of muscle at the shoulder. Its arms hang down to its knees, and end in short stubby fingers. It has no neck, and a large head with broad flat features. Its legs are short and bowed, with wide flat feet. A clay golem wears no clothing except for a metal or stiff leather garment around its hips. It smells faintly of clay. The golem can not speak, or make any noise. It walks and moves with a slow and clumsy gait, almost as if it were not in control over its actions.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Clay golems conform to the strategies listed above for the flesh golem except as noted here. A clay golem has a strength of 20 for the purposes of lifting, throwing or smashing objects. They can only be struck by magical blunt weapons such as hammers or maces. A <i>move earth </i>spell will drive the golem back 120 feet and inflict 3-36 (3d12) points of damage upon it. A <i>disintegrate </i>spell merely <i>slows </i>the golem for 1-6 rounds and causes <b>1-12 points of damage </b>. An <i>earthquake </i>spell cast directly at a clay golem will stop it from moving that turn and inflict 5-50 (5d10) points of damage. After it has engaged in at least one round of combat, the clay golem can haste itself for 3 rounds. It can only do this once per day. Damage done by the golem can only be cured by a <i>heal </i>spell from a priest of 17th level or greater.</p>
					<p>The elemental spirit in a lesser golem is not bound strongly, resulting in a 1% cumulative chance per round of combat, calculated independently for each fight, that it will break free of its master. If a clay golem does manage to break control, it becomes a berserker, attacking everything in sight until it is destroyed. Its first action is to <i>haste </i>itself, if it can. Unlike the flesh golem, there is no chance to regain control of a rampaging clay golem.</p>

					<p>Haunting the deep reaches of the Ethereal and Astral Planes, the creatures known as devourers have a reputation for being among the most fearsome and loathsome of foes. For many planewalkers, they embody the true nature of evil (despite the fact that they don't come from the Lower P1anes). See, Devourer have so little regard for anyone but themselves that they're willing to steal the life essence of other beings to power their own magic.</p>
					<p>Nothing about a devourer's appearance gives the impression that it's anything other than a horrible monster. A gaunt, skeletal creature of great height, it usually has a tiny figure trapped within what appears to be the bones of its rib cage. This captive is obviously powerless and clearly suffers great distress and pain, though he often has a look about him that indicates that he's been imprisoned for a long, long time.</p>
					<h>Combat:</h>
					<p>Most cutters fear the devourer, and with good reason. Sure, its large, crooked claws inflict <b>2d6 points of damage </b>per strike, but even worse, its touch also drains one energy level. If wounded in battle, a devourer regains a number of hit points equal to those permanently lost by a victim from whom it drained a level.</p>
					<p>What's more, the creature can capture a berk's entire life essence - truly a fate far worse than death. To steal a spirit, the devourer must roll a successful attack against its chosen victim. <b><u>The sod must then make a successful saving throw vs. death magic to avoid the effect </u></b>. If he fails the saving throw, he's slain, and his spirit becomes trapped within the devourer. Onlookers can see it appear within the rib cage of the skeletal horror.</p>
					<p>A captive spirit is completely unable to act and can't be restored by a <i>raise dead </i>spell. Fact is, all it can do is serve as fuel for the devourer's spells and abilities. The greater the level or Hit Dice of the trapped spirit, the more power it provides to its 'host'. And because a devourer's rib cage can hold only one spirit at a time, the creature always seeks to prey upon the mightiest victims it can find. While it holds a trapped spirit, a devourer can use the following spell-like powers at will, once per round: <i>confusion </i>, <i>control undead </i>, <i>paralysis </i>(as the wand), <i>ray of enfeeblement </i>, <i>spectral hand </i>(which it can use to drain levels, but not steal spirits), <i>suggestion </i>, <i>summon shadow </i>, and <i>true seeing </i>. Each level or Hit Die of the captive gives the devourer a total of five power uses. Once it has completely consumed the spirit in this manner, the sod's life essence is destroyed forever and the devourer must find a new victim.</p>
					<p>In addition to powering spell-like abilities, the captive spirit offers the devourer magical protection. If a cutter casts any of the following spells upon the creature (and if they penetrate its magic resistance), they affect the trapped spirit instead: <i>banishment </i>, <i>chaos </i>, <i>confusion </i>, <i>dispel evil </i>, <i>emotion </i>, <i>entrapment </i>, <i>ESP </i>, <i>fear </i>, <i>geas </i>, <i>holy word </i>, <i>imprisonment </i>, <i>magic jar </i>, <i>maze </i>, <i>quest </i>, <i>spirit wrack </i>, <i>trap the soul </i>, and any type of <i>charm </i>, <i>domination </i>, <i>hypnosis </i>, or <i>suggestion </i>.</p>
					<p>Note that some of these spells (including <i>banishment </i>, <i>dispel evil </i>, and <i>entrapment </i>) get rid or the trapped spirit, leaving the devourer's rib cage empty. If this occurs, the creature can't use any of its spell-like powers - or protect itself from the above-named spells - until it finds a new victim. And what becomes of the spirit, once released from its skeletal prison? Well, the basher's still in the dead-book, but at least the spirit is free to go to the plane of its alignment (and can also be brought back to life with <i>raise dead </i>).</p>
					<p>When encountered, a devourer will almost always have a captive spirit in its rib cage (85% change). The Dungeon Master should roll 3d4+3 to randomly determine how many Hit Dice or levels the victim has left for its captor to utilize.</p>
					<h>Habitat/Society:</h>
					<p>Some folks believe that only one devourer exists, that it's a unique creature. Wishful thinking - it's very pretty well confirmed that that's not the case. However, exactly what the creatures <i>are </i>is still a mystery. Are they a predator race found only on the Silver Void and the Misty Shore? Are they the magical creations of a viciously evil wizard? Are they manifestations of something else entirely - perhaps the most despicable thoughts and emotions that end up on the Astral? No one's tumbled to the dark of it yet. Fact is, no one even knows if the things can communicate, though it's been theorized that they're telepathic.</p>
					<p>When a planewalker stumbles across a devourer, the creature's always alone (except for its captive spirit, of course). Nothing alive seems to tolerate the monsters' presence; they even appear to abhor one another. Furthermore, devourers are encountered only when they're out hunting for victims from whom they can drain levels or steal spirits. If the creatures do make lairs on the Astral and the Ethereal, such places've never been found. Perhaps that's for the best.</p>
					<h>Ecology:</h>
					<p>It's not known how (or if) devourers reproduce. They subsist totally on life energy, needing no actual food or drink. Despite their appearance and their requirements for existence, they're not undead.</p>
					<p>Chant has it that a few bashers have encountered devourers on the Negative Energy Plane, but who'd believe the word of anyone who'd willingly go to such a horrible place? Others contend that while devourers spend most of their time on the Astral or the Ethereal, they do indeed make occasional trips to the Negative Energy Plane, for reasons unknown. Unlike undead, they have no direct connection to the plane (hence their ability to go to the Astral and even beyond, if they wished), but they do seem to make the odd 'pilgrimage' now and then - no doubt because of their nature.</p>
