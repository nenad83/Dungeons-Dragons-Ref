        "Text": " This is the basic stripped down infantry soldier. Ten-sided hit dice, full use of any weapons or armor, and the best combat tables combine to make fighting the essentials of this character. Fighters also increase in the number of attacks they get as they gain levels. Fighters must have a strength of at least 9 and a constitution of at least 7, and benefit from high dexterity as well. A fighter with a strength above 15 gains a 10% bonus on experience.  They may be of any alignment. Fighters have no magic abilities, but may use many magic items, including all magic weapons and armor.  They may specialize in any single weapon; weapon specialization is explained in connection with weapon proficiencies.  They begin with four weapon slots.  Among fighter-type classes, the fighter itself is the stripped model, with no special abilities and no special restrictions. At level 9, the fighter lord may establish a freehold by building some type of castle and clearing the land in an area of a radius of twenty to fifty miles.  The fighter will then attract a body of men-at-arms led by an above average fighter which will serve him as long as he pays reasonably and maintains his freehold, and will collect seven silver coins for every sentient inhabitant of the area through trade, tariffs, and taxes.",

        "Text": "The Paladin was originally introduced as a subclass of fighter; but with the introduction of the cavalier class in the arcana rules it became of subclass of that new class.  Some referees never made the alteration, and some permitted both versions to exist, so the two versions are described and distinguished in this text.\nThe character must be Lawful Good; failure to maintain that alignment may result in the permanent loss of all special powers of the class, reverting to either a fighter or a cavalier main class.  Charisma of a paladin must be at least 17, wisdom 13, strength 12, intelligence and constitution 9; arcana rules (reflected on the chart for the method five rolling system) require that these minimums be raised where necessary to meet those of the cavalier (15/10/13/15/15/17/3).  A 10% experience point bonus was given to those with both strength and wisdom above 15; this was eliminated in the arcana version.  Arcana rules also required that the character be born of the appropriate social class, or sponsored by a noble house.  Any paladin rolling a social class below Lower Middle Class will be lower middle class, as peasants below that status will not be accepted.  Characters of at least Lower Upper Class begin the game as first level Armigers; others must begin as 0 level Horsemen (0H), and work through Lancer (0L) to reach this point.  Such lower class characters always serve the house of another; Upper Class cavaliers may serve their own house.\n\nShould the paladin knowingly performs a chaotic act, he must perform an act of penance prescribed by a cleric of at least level 7.  Knowing and willing performance of an evil act causes irrevocable loss of the abilities which distinguish the paladin from the main class from which it is drawn.\n\nThe Paladin is a class of mounted warriors, knights a cut above the fighter both in combat and in society.  They adhere to Chivalry, and have strong ties to a religious order.  They have abilities reminiscent of the clerics to which they are so similar.  They may detect evil at 60' whenever they take the time to concentrate on doing so in the correct direction.  They gain +2 on all saving throws, and are immune to all forms of disease.  By laying on hands, they may cure up to 2 points of damage per level on any one character per day (including himself); by this means he may also cure diseases at the rate of one individual per week for each five levels of experience (rounding fractions up) gained.  He also radiates a continuous protection from evil field to a radius of one game inch in all directions.\n\nHe dispels undead as if a cleric of two levels lower (thus this ability begins at level 3).  He may call for a special warhorse at any time after reaching level 4, a remarkable animal faster and stronger and smarter than any normal horse.  The paladin may replace this animal with a new similar animal not more often than every ten years.  Only the paladin can properly wield a holy sword to its full potential, including its full +5 bonuses and its ability to dispel magic.  Beginning at the ninth level of experience, the paladin may use cleric spells, starting with a single first level spell and expanding to three spells of each of the first four levels at level 20.\n\nHowever, the character pays for these advantages with several restrictions.\n\nHe may never own more than ten magic items.  Further, he is restricted to owning a single suit of armor, a single shield, four weapons, and only four items which do not fit into these categories.  In counting weapons, weapons which intrinsically must work together--such as bows and batches of arrows--are counted as a single weapon.\n\nThey are required to give away excessive wealth, keeping only that which is necessary to meet personal expenses and maintain his troops and fortifications.  However much he receives, he will automatically give away 10% of all wealth as it comes in.  This will be given to non-player clerical institutions.\n\nThe paladin is restricted in the alignments of characters with whom he may associate.  All of his henchmen must be lawful good, and his other associates must all be good.  He may participate in an adventure in which he is working with non-evil neutrals only if it is limited to a single expedition, and only if it will further a lawful good cause.\n\nIn addition to the stricture that they may only associate long-term with lawful good characters, they will only form alliances with fighters, clerics, and cavaliers, of noble birth or status.  Under the original rules, paladins do not attract men-at-arms or similar fighters; however, under the arcana rules, they gain retainers as a cavalier, but not the additional troops.",

        "Text": "An original basic character class, the thief specializes in stealth, pilfering, and similar skills.  The profession is not intrinsically dishonorable, but there is a tendency to distrust and in some quarters disdain such characters.\nThieves must have a dexterity of at least 9, and only their wisdom may be below 6; a thief with a dexterity above 15 gains a 10% bonus on his experience.  They are usually not allowed to be good, and never allowed to be lawful good; the majority are evil.  They gain d6 hit points per level, may use many different weapons, and are allowed some armor.  They also have very specific \"thief skills\" which improve with level.\nPicking pockets is an essential skill for thieves.  It includes stealing small objects, done by light touch and sleight of hand.  At first level, the character has a 30% chance of success; however, this roll may be penalized if an attempt is made to pick the pocket of an upper-level character.\nThe thief has a 25% chance to open locks and other security devices.  Viking thieves do not have this skill, but are able to open barred doors, beginning with a 10% chance.\n\nThe character is also skilled at finding and removing small traps, such as needle traps, springing blades, and other traps which could be used to protect a chest or other small container (not trapped doors, hallways, and other large-scale traps).  This begins at 20%, and is also unknown to Viking thieves.\nMoving silently is an essential part of the character's stealth abilities.  At level one, the character has a 15% chance of making no sound even when crossing a squeaky wooden floor.\nThe thief can also hide in shadows, provided that there are shadows (and therefore light--the character is not invisible to infravision in total darkness) and the character is properly attired.  This begins as a 10% chance of success.\nThere is a 10% chance that the level one character will be able to hear any noise which is there to hear when he stops and listens, such as by pressing his ear against a door.\n\nHe can climb walls, provided the wall is typically rough and cracked; initially the chance of success is 85%.\nThe thief gains added damage in the form of a multiplier--double damage at level one--when he strikes an enemy unexpected from behind.  This attack is referred to as a \"backstab\", and is bonused +4 on the chance to hit.\n\nAll thieves speak a limited language called \"Thieves' Cant\", used primarily for planning jobs, but enabling all to speak with each other.\nThey gain the limited ability to read other languages, as for example deciphering the writings on treasure maps.  This does not begin until level 4, and at that point is 20%.  At level 10, they can also read magical writings and cast spells from scrolls (not including cleric spells), although they frequently get the magic wrong.\nThieves don't create freeholds or other domains; however, at level 10 they can create a fortress in or near a city, and attract 4d6 thieves by founding a guild.  If there is already a guild in the city (nearly always the case), there will be a guild war as a fight to the death between the two guilds.\nThieves are permitted to wear simple leather armor without any penalty.  Under the arcana rules, thieves wearing no armor gain specific bonuses on some skills, and thieves may wear studded leather, padded armor, or elfin chain mail, but will not be permitted any dexterity bonuses on their skills, and will take a penalty on them as well.  Shield use is not permitted.  Weapons which are large, complex, or require loose pieces are not allowed; this leaves about a dozen weapons, several of them sword variants.",

        "Text": "Assassins are a sub-class of thieves, and they have some functions of the thief as well as their own.  To be an assassin, a character must have these minimum ability scores:  12/11/6/12/6/3/-15.  Assassins gain no experience point bonus for high ability scores.Just as thieves, assassins have d6 hp per level.  They must be aligned evil.  They can use any sort of weapon, but are restricted as thieves in armor, and may only use other types of armor as part of a disguise (i.e., they cannot fight effectively in armor).  Shields may be used, but interfere with thieving functions.The assassin character need not be a member of the local assassins guild, but all NPC assassins are members.  There is usually one such guild in most towns or cities, which controls a 10 to 100 mile radius area around the headquarters.  Any assassin discovered in the area will be invited to join, thus coming under the authority and command of the Guildmaster Assassin.  The character need not join, but will be under penalty of death if he performs an assassination while not a guild member.The primary function of assassins is killing.  They may use poison, ingested or insinuated by weapon.  Ingested poison must be put into the food or drink, and the character performing this action must detail exactly when, where, and how the poisoning will be done; the DM will then adjudicate the action.  Poisoned weapons used run the risk of being noticed by others.  All non-assassins within 10' of the bared weapon have a 10% cumulative chance each per mr of noting the poison and attacking the poison-using assassin (20%) or calling for the city watch (50%) or both (30%).Assassins attack on the same combat table as thieves, including backstabbing.  However, if they surprise a victim, they may attack on the assassination table.  This gives a roughly 50% chance of immediately killing the victim; and if this fails, normal damage according to weapon type and strength still accrues to the victim.  Further, if a poisoned weapon is used, the victim must also make a save vs. poison to avoid the effects.  The assassin decides whether to use assassination, backstabbing, or normal melee. Primary abilities of assassins which enhance their function are those of being able to speak alignment languages and being able to disguise, as follows - 1)  Assassins with intelligence of 15 or more are able to learn an alignment tongue or special language (such as druidic or thieves' cant).  This ability is gained at 9th level (Assassin) and with each advance in experience level thereafter.  The maximum number of such languages which can be spoken (apart from his own alignment language) is one per point of intelligence above 14.  (Note that the current number is also limited to one per level over 8.)2)  Disguise can be donned in order to gain the opportunity to poison or surprise a victim--or for other reasons.  The assassin can disguise himself so as to appear to be a human, demi-human, or humanoid creature of either gender.  Disguise can lower height by up to three inches, or raise it by up to five inches.  It can make the assassin look slimmer or appear much heavier.  Disguise can make the assassin appear to be virtually any class of character, a simple pilgrim, a merchant, etc.  There is a chance, however, that the victim, or one of his henchmen or guards, will notice the disguise.  There is a base 2% per day of a disguised assassin being spotted.  This chance goes upwards by 2% if the assassin is posing as another class, another race, and/or the opposite sex (cumulative, maximum 8%).  Each concerned party (victim, henchman, bodyguards) in proximity to the assassin will be checked for, immediately upon meeting the disguised assassin and each 24 hour period thereafter.  This chance is adjusted for particular individuals by intelligence + wisdom-24.  Note that True Seeing, Enemy Detection, Detect Evil, and Know Alignment may in certain cases reveal a disguised assassin.The secondary function of the assassin is spying.  This mission can be coupled with the stealing of some item.Tertiary functions of the assassin are the same as thieves.  They have all the abilities and functions of thieves--picking pockets, opening locks, finding/removing traps, moving silently, hiding in shadows, listening at doors, climbing walls, backstabbing, reading languages, reading magic--but they perform all these functions two levels below their assassin level, i.e., the third level assassin has the thieving abilities of a first level thief.  Backstabbing is the exception to this rule; this is performed at the assassins level.  Note that the ability to speak thieves' cant is not included, but can be learned in lieu of an alignment language at the appropriate level.Performing an assassination will gain experience points for the character, awarded for both the fee paid and the level of the victim, starting at 50 gp for a first level assassin to kill a zero-level character, up to 250,000 gp for a fifteenth level assassin to kill a sixteenth level or greater character.  Important, popular, and/or noble victims will be considered as being above their actual level with respect to fee.  Especially popular characters could be worth three times their level. An assassin character cannot have any hirelings until he attains fourth level (they might turn him in!); at that time lower level assassins may be taken into service.  Upon attaining eighth level, the character may also include thieves and thief-acrobats amongst his hirelings.  Upon attaining twelfth level, the character may hire any class desired.  Of course, only neutral or evil characters will serve an assassin.  The total number of henchmen is that dictated by the character's charisma score.  \"Followers\" are also possible, but these come only at the two uppermost levels of the assassin class. In order for an assassin character to gain experience levels above the thirteenth (Prime Assassin), he or she must have the requisite experience points and then either assassinate the local Guildmaster Assassin (fourteenth level) or challenge him to a duel to the death.  Likewise, a fourteenth level player character assassin can journey to the place where the Grandfather of Assassins (fifteenth level) has his headquarters and slay him by assassination or in a duel.  Note that duplicity, trickery, ambush, and all forms of treachery are considered fair by assassins.  A higher level character can accept a challenge and then have the challenger slain by archers, for instance. As Guildmaster Assassin, a character will have a body of guild members which numbers 7d4.  Upon a change of leadership it is 75% likely that each guild member will leave the area.  Thus, it will be necessary for the new Guildmaster to allow new members into the guild.  These new assassins will all be first level and must be worked up in experience levels.  The maximum number of such \"followers\" of the local guild will be set by the referee.  They are in addition to normal henchmen.  Note that guild members are loyal only to strength, power, and profit.\nThe headquarters of a guild is always within a large town or big city.  It must not be a noticeable fortress or an ostentatious place.  It is typically a warehouse or other nondescript structure, with safeguards and traps added.  This avoids attention and unwanted notoriety.  All expenses of maintaining the guild and its members--excluding the Guildmaster--are assumed to be fully paid for by normal guild activities.  Any improvements, changes, the expenses of the leader, and all other special costs must be borne by the Guildmaster Assassin.\n\nThe headquarters of the Grandfather of Assassins can be virtually anywhere and of any form--cavern, castle, monastery, palace, temple, you name it.  However, if it is a large and obvious place, the headquarters must be located well away from all communities--such as in the midst of a murky woods, a dismal marsh or fen, a lonely moor, a deserted island, a remote coast, or far into forsaken hills or atop a mountain.  Upon attaining the headship of all assassins, the new Grandfather must pay all remaining followers of the former head 1000 gp for each of their experience levels, destroy the old headquarters, and construct a new one somewhere else.  (The old headquarters will clearly not be safe, due to whatever revenge-based insurance the former Grandfather had arranged to avenge his own death, either based on traps and secrets within the building, or on pre-paid avengers who know the location.)\n\nAny occidental except Hobbits may be assassins, Humans (15), any Dwarfs (9, up to 12), any Gnomes (8, up to 10) except Tinker Gnomes, any Elves (10, up to 12), Half-elves (11), and Half-orcs (15).",

        "Text": "The cleric can best be described as a type of battlefield priest.  While he in some ways is like a knight of holy orders (and is so described), such a designation better describes a paladin or cavalier.  The cleric is much less a fighter, much more a man of the cloth.  They serve a fully religious function within the game, rendering aid to those in need, but at the same time are able to fight adequately, better than any other original non-fighter class, should the need arise. The cleric has a minimum wisdom of 9; if wisdom is greater than 15, the character gains a 10% bonus on experience in the cleric class.  All other ability scores must be at least 6, except for dexterity, which may be 3, and comeliness, which has no minimum.  High wisdom also will increase the spell power of the cleric.  High strength, constitution, and dexterity are also especially desirable, but not required. The cleric gains d8 hp per level, plus non-fighter constitution bonuses.  He is dedicated to one or more deities.  Any alignment other than true neutral is possible (only druids can be true neutral cleric types), but should be reasonably related to that of the god or gods served.  Holy symbols of the faith are used in the performance of ritual spells.  They may not use edged or pointed weapons, weapons which principally draw blood. The combat table for clerics is not as good at advancing levels as that for fighters, and they do not gain multiple attacks; however, they are better and advance in combat skill faster than magic-user or thief classes, and may use any armor.  Likewise, their spells are much less aggressive.  Although there are attack spells, these are less powerful than those in the magic user classes for the same level, and are overwhelmed by the number of healing and protection spells.  Unlike magic user classes, the cleric does not need to keep a spell book, and has access to any spell of any level which he is experienced enough to cast; at higher levels, the cleric may have to justify the selection of certain powerful spells to his god, who ultimately controls the granting of such more potent spells and expects them to be used in a way consistent with his alignment and interests.  Clerics also have the power to \"turn\" undead creatures, such as skeletons, driving them away from or destroying them by virtue of his own holy presence.  Such power has a chance of working against ghasts, ghosts, ghouls, liches, mummies, shadows, skeletons, spectres, wights, wraiths, vampires, zombies, many other undead creatures, certain minor demons and devils, and rarely character types who have an extremely powerful connection to a god opposed to the cleric (an evil cleric may for example drive away a paladin).  Generally the power is effective against creatures whose hit dice are not greater than the level of the cleric. Clerics may use most potions (those not restricted to another class), clerical and protection scrolls, most rings, some wands, rods, and staves, many other magical items, any magic armor, and any magic weapon which they would be permitted to use if non-magical. At level 8, the patriarch or matriarch may build a place of worship of at least 2000 square feet with an altar and appropriate facilities such as a chapel or a shrine.  If this is done, between 20 and 200 followers will come to the cleric, plus additional men-at-arms to assist in defending the place.  At level 9, the high priest or priestess may construct a religious stronghold, such as a castle, monastery, or abbey.  It must contain within it a temple, cathedral, or church of at least 2500 square feet on the ground floor, and dedicated totally to the character's deity or deities.  Costs for this will be cut in half due to volunteer labor and increased contributions.  If the cleric subsequently clears the surrounding area such that humans (or other character races if the cleric is not human) can and do settle the area, the cleric will earn nine silver pieces per inhabitant from trade, taxation, and tithes.",

        "Text": "The druid is a sub-class of cleric.  They are the ultimate example of the True Neutral alignment, viewing good, evil, law, and chaos as balancing natural forces necessary for the continuation of all things.  Minimum ability scores are 6/6/12/6/15/6/3; a druid with both wisdom and charisma greater than 15 will earn a 10% bonus on experience.  They gain d8 hit points per level through level 15.\nDruid spells are intended to strengthen, protect, and revitalize a party as a cleric, but his spells are more attuned to nature.  Their spells are more powerful as attacks than clerics, and they can use a greater variety of weapons (the restriction against drawing blood does not apply), but they may not use any metallic armor or shield.  Since such metallic protections would prevent the druid from being able to perform his magic, he may only wear leather or padded armor or none, and may carry only wood shields.\n\nSpells are spoken or read aloud.  There is no dispel power over undead or other creatures such as clerics use, because druids are involved with living things of this world.  Although they have many of the same healing spells as clerics, they do not have these available at level one.\n\nTrees are sacred to the druid, especially oak and ash; they also do homage to the sun and moon personified.  (They are animists, worshipping the spirits in these objects.)  Mistletoe is the principle holy symbol of the druid; the quality of the mistletoe may control the efficacy of spells.  They protect trees, wild plants, and crops as a primary religious duty, followed by a duty toward druidic followers and animals.  They oppose the destruction of forests and other natural environs absolutely, and oppose killing animals except when necessary for survival.  They may eat meat.  Druids are unlikely to risk their own lives in protecting their charges, but will usually take vengeance later.\n\nAt level 3, the druid can identify plant type, animal type, and pure water.  He can also pass through overgrown areas such as tangled thorns and briar patches at normal movement rates without leaving a trail.\n\nAt level 7, the druid is immune to the charm spells of such woodland creatures as dryads, nixies, and sylphs.  Such a druid also is able to change once per day to any mammal, once to any reptile, and once to any bird.  The creature must be a real natural creature not smaller than a bat, bullfrog, or bluejay, up to about twice the weight of the druid.  The change will also heal d6x10% of any damage taken by the druid.\n\nDruids speak druidic as an additional language.  Beginning at level 3, the druid learns one language per level chosen by the character from these languages:  centaur, dryad, elfish, faun, gnome, green dragon, hill giant, lizardman, manticore, nixie, pixie, sprite, treantish.  These languages are in addition to those learned as part of the character's language limit, so the druid may exceed the number of languages he may know by intelligence and race.\n\nDruids fight and save as clerics, but are +2 against fire and lightning and all other electrical attacks.  They may use any magic item not limited to a particular class except those weapons and armor which are prohibited to them, and may use any clerical items which are not written (such as scrolls and books).  They may use druid scrolls.\n\nThere are only nine druids of level twelve; each has three assistants.  These assistants are the same level for each druid, but each druid has higher level assistants according to the relationship between their current experience.  Thus, the twelfth-level Druid with the least experience (in points) is served by three level-one druids, and the one with the most experience is served by three ninth-level druids.  The single thirteenth-level Archdruid is served by three initiates of the eighth circle, and the fourteenth-level Great Druid is served by nine initiates of the ninth circle.  These servitors and protectors are not henchmen; the druids may have henchmen in addition to this.\n\nA character may only achieve twelfth-level Druid if there is a vacancy or he bests one of the nine current Druids in spell or hand-to-hand combat.  If the combat is not mortal, the loser drops to the beginning of level eleven, initiate of the ninth circle.  This process is repeated for becoming the thirteenth-level Archdruid (with the loser reverting to Druid) and the fourteenth-level Great Druid (with the loser reverting to Archdruid).",
